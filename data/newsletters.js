                "Australia's Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell says he has intelligence from the whaling community that Japan is planning to hunt humpback and fin whales for \"scientific\" research. Japan last year increased its kill of minke whales to more than 450. Senator Campbell now believes Japan is softening the ground to go ahead and expand its whale kill under the legal loophole which allows the taking of whales for scientific research.",
                "\"Their institute for research on whales and dolphins has come out and said that, based on their own assessment, the improvement - and I'm paraphrasing them here - that the improvement in the minke stocks that have been witnessed in recent years have now started to diminish,\" Senator Campbell said.",
                "\"Now, one would have to say that that is an admission from the top cetacean scientists in Japan, that minke stocks are now under threat, and they have said in the same document that they've witnessed an increase, which we have witnessed as well, we didn't need to go killing whales to witness this increase, but they have witnessed an increase in humpback whales and fin whales. This is what naturally occurs if you stop killing them, and therefore they are - I believe - softening the ground to go out and take humpback and fin whales.\"",
                "Australia failed for a fifth time last year at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to secure a southern whale sanctuary. Senator Campbell says he is considering how best to get the sanctuary in place. \"It's an issue that's very important to Australia and New Zealand. I've discussed it with the US in recent days,\" he said. \"I'm going to progress that proposal in a way that's got the very best chance of success.\"",

                "Whales sing at a low frequency, at the very bottom of the range of human hearing. To hear the whales, \"you have to broaden your listening range,\" said Christopher Clark of Cornell University, adding that \"their voices are beautifully adapted for long-range transmission. By singing at low frequencies, whales are able to communicate across oceans - it's how they keep track of their pod and alert friends of a good place to eat.\"",
                "But Clark and other scientists are concerned that the growing \"acoustic smog\" in the world's oceans, and particularly the waters near popular migration and feeding routes, is interfering with whales' ability to communicate with songs. \"A blue whale, which lives 100 years, that was born in 1940, today has had his acoustic bubble shrunken from 1,000 miles to 100 miles because of noise pollution,\" said Clark. \"The noise pollution is estimated to be at the industrial noise level where OSHA would require us to wear headphones.\" Noise pollution is doubling every decade in an urbanized marine environment, Clark claims, mostly due to shipping traffic. \"If females can no longer hear the singing males through the smog, they lose breeding opportunities and choices,\" he said. Clark suggested that the shipping industry overhaul their ships and begin using quieter propellers. A more economically feasible fix might be to reroute shipping traffic so that it no longer passed through popular whale habitats, he said. Very little is known about whale communication.",
                "\"Suddenly you realize that their behavior is defined not by my scale, or any other whale researcher's scale, but by a whale's sense of scale - ocean basin-sized.\" Whale sonar is also important for navigation. \"Whales will aim directly at a seamount that is 300 miles away, then once they reach it, change course and head to a new feature,\" Clark said. \"It is as if they are slaloming from one geographic feature to the next. They must have acoustic memories analogous to our visual memories.\" Populations declining drastically In separate research presented this weekend, DNA analysis of whales shows their populations grew steadily through history, with drastic declines recently. \"Whales have shown remarkable resilience to cataclysmic events - until the last one - which is us,\" said Steve Palumbi of Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station."

                "Interspecies received two books in April, on the subject of bird songs.  Both possess stunningly beautiful covers. Both also have companion CDs.",
                "<span class=\"italics\">Why Bird's Sing: A Journey into the Mystery of Bird Song</span>, by David Rothenberg, (Basic Books, 2005)",
                "David is an advisor to Interspecies. He is a professor of philosophy, and an often-recorded clarinetist, with an abiding interest in adapting music to communicate with other species. He is also one of the featured composers in our own Belly of the Whale Project.",
                "<span class=\"italics\">Why Birds Sing</span> provides an engaging overview to the entire subject of bird song. It develops as an entertaining narrative that seamlessly merges biology, music, and poetry to unfold its story. Why? As David makes amply clear, the human drive to understand and attach meaning to bird song can only be told accurately by granting equal authority to poets like Walt Whitman and Keats, composers like Oliver Messiaen, and a small community of biologists, naturalists, and acoustic engineers, the wisest of whom clearly recognize poetry and music as equal partners in this venture.",
                "The birds he describes display personality, intelligence and eye-opening social skills. From the Interspecies perspective of honoring the animals, its most important conclusion is that bird song is certainly our most accessible example for undertanding precisely how certain other species learn from their elders a sense of aesthetics informed by internal rules, and sophisticated improvisational techniques. Several birds utilize the same scales as human musicians. So who invented music, birds or humans? After reading this book, and then listening a few times to the incredible song of the lyrebird on the CD, I conclude it is really no contest.",
                "The CD for Rothenberg's book must be purchased separately. It features musicians interacting with birds from several places around the planet.",
                "<span class=\"italics\">Nature's Music: The Science of Birdsong</span>, Peter Marler and Hans Slabbekorn (Elsevier, 2004)",
                "Visit this website for info about the conference, in memory of bird expert, Louis Baptista, that inspired this anthology.",
                "Although this is a scientist's book - a collection of professional papers and essays about birdsong — it pays its dues to the poets, naturalists and musicians wqho have always been an essneital part of the discussion. Likewise, it subtly acknowledges bird song as an art form evolved among another family of sentient beings. If you enjoyed David Rothenberg's overview of a book, and desire a more in-depth explanation of how bird brains work, how various species physically generate those exotic timbres, the tools and methods of acoustic science, and a good explanation of current biology on the subject, then this your book. How to describe the narrative? If you took a college-level course on bird song or bio-acoustics, I guarantee you would be thrilled to be assigned this accessible book as the main text.",
                "The two CDs that accompany this book are absolute gems, containing more than 200 sound samples of various birds. Almost every sound you hear is also explained in some detail within the text, most of these accompanied by sonograms. Digital composers take note of this resource as a sample library. And get permission.",
                "Reading these two accounts of bird song research has been an enlightening experience for this reviewer who mostly explores whale vocalizations as a source for discovering another species' aesthetics and language. By contrast to the open-minded bird acousticians, the whale research community seems overly close-minded, intellectually bigoted, and exclusivist about allowing poets and musicians, even naturalists and nature writers share their turf. As if the rest of us need their permission. If I could be granted a wish, it would that these two books — ideally prefaced by this review — be mandatory reading by every young graduate student of whale behavior, everywhere in the world. I do not exaggerate to conclude that, if whale research began to reflect some of the ecumenical traits of bird research, it would inspire a veritable transformation in cetacean science. The whales, many of whom exist on the brink of extinction (and who are about to fall prey to increased whaling by several Asian countries) would be the foremost beneficiaries.",

            content: [  
                "Prairie dogs, those rodents popping in and out of holes on vacant lots and rural rangeland, are talking up a storm. They have different \"words\" for tall human in yellow shirt, short human in green shirt, coyote, deer, red-tailed hawk and many other creatures. They can even coin new terms for things they've never seen before, independently coming up with the same calls or words, according to Con Slobodchikoff, a Northern Arizona University biology professor and prairie dog linguist. Prairie dogs of the Gunnison's species, which Slobodchikoff has studied, speak different dialects in Grants and Taos, N.M.; Flagstaff, Ariz.; and Monarch Pass, Colo., but they would likely understand one another, the professor says. \"So far, I think we are showing the most sophisticated communication system that anyone has shown in animals,\" Slobodchikoff said.",
                "Prairie dog chatter is variously described by observers as a series of yips, high-pitched barks or eeks. And most scientists think prairie dogs simply make sounds that reflect their inner condition. That means all they're saying are things like \"ouch\" or \"hungry\" or \"eek.\" Linguists have set five criteria that must be met for something to qualify as language: It must contain words with abstract meanings; possess syntax in which the order of words is part of their meaning; have the ability to coin new words; be composed of smaller elements; and use words separated in space and time from what they represent.",
                "\"I've been chipping away at all of these,\" Slobodchikoff said. He and his students have done work in the field and in a laboratory. With digital recorders, they record the calls prairie dogs make as they see different people, dogs of different sizes and with different coat colors, hawks, elk. They analyze the sounds using a computer that dissects the underlying structure and creates a sonogram, or visual representation of the sound. Computer analysis later identifies the similarities and differences. The prairie dogs have calls for various predators but also for elk, deer, antelope and cows. \"It's as if they're trying to inform one another what's out there,\" Slobodchikoff said. So far, he has recorded at least 20 different \"words.\" Some of those words or calls were created by the prairie dogs when they saw something for the first time. Four prairie dogs in Slobodchikoff's lab were shown a great-horned owl and European ferret, two animals they had likely not seen before, if only because the owls are mostly nocturnal and this kind of ferret is foreign. The prairie dogs independently came up with the same new calls. Slobodchikoff has also played back a recorded prairie dog alarm call for coyote in a prairie dog colony when no coyote was around. The prairie dogs had the same escape response as they did when the predator was really there. Computer analysis has been able to break down some prairie dog calls into different components, suggesting the critters have yet another element of a real language."

This figure is up from 670 last year, even though whalers last year failed to meet their target, due to backlogs at processing factories. This is the largest quota allowed since Norway re-launched commercial whale hunting in 1993 in defiance of an International Whaling Commission moratorium in place since 1986.",
                "2. Japan is set to expand its annual whale hunt to take two new species. Under a new plan for what Tokyo calls its \"research whaling program\", Japan would take humpback whales and fin whales in addition to the four whale species it currently hunts. Japan abandoned commercial whaling in 1986 in line with an international ban, but began a program to hunt whales in what it calls scientific research whaling the following year. The meat ends up on store shelves and on the tables of gourmet restaurants. The new plan calls for Japan initially to hunt around 10 humpbacks and 10 fin whales per year, Kyodo said, and to sharply increase the number of minkes it takes each year. Japan last expanded its hunt in 2002, when it added sei whales to the list, setting off an international furor. It also takes sperm whales and Bryde's whales. A Fisheries Agency official said: \"It has been recorded that the populations of the humpback and fin whales in the Antarctic are increasing. Nobody disputes this.\" Japanese officials had said they would continue whaling even if the plan was rejected at the IWC meeting in South Korea this summer.",

Reviewing the building plans, observers conclude that this is the start of large-scale industrial whaling within a culture that has not hunted whales in many years."

Interspecies.com editor, Jim Nollman was playing guitar through an underwater speaker on the Shelmar, skippered by Bob Wood, when the boat was surrounded by 300 Pacific whitesided dolphins accompanied by three humpback whales. Over an entire day, the boat was never out of site of this vast herd. Up to six dolphins at a time swarmed within inches of the speaker and hydrophone, vocalizing with rare fidelity, improvising rhythms and melodies in close synchrony with the raga being played into the water. The result was over six hours of recording, eventually whittled down to a contiguous six minutes and named Dolphin Realtime.",

Musicians often comment about the sophistication of harmony and rhythm. Many whale scientists, however, declare that nothing is happening. Who can be certain, they declare, that the dolphins would not be making the same sounds if we weren't present.",

The Board of the SSS made this decision in response to Japan's plan to target endangered humpback and fin whales in Antarctica. Paul recently published an essay about the language of exploiters, excerpted below. Click here to read more about the group's unique activist stance.",
                "Commentary by Paul Watson",
                "We need to put an end to jargon that is employed to justify ecological exploitation.",
                "Let's start with the Canadian seal hunt. This is not a hunt. No one is tracking, stalking, or pursuing seals. The sealers merely walk through a nursery of defenseless seal pups and whack them on the head. The little fellas can't escape, and they can't defend themselves. Let's call it what it is: a slaughter or a massacre.",
                "Nor do we harvest seals or fish or any other animal. We harvest corn, oranges, or apples but not seals or fish. I notice farmers don't use the term for cows or pigs. They slaughter their cows and pigs. So' why the use of this word?  It's just an attempt to remove the ugliness of their actions.",
                "The Canadian government has tried to label baby seals as adults by defining an adult as any seal over three weeks age.  It seems to me that any seal that can't swim, can't escape, and is helpless on an ice floe at three weeks of age qualifies as a baby seal.",
                "And this word sustainable? This gem was dreamed up by that whale-killing former Prime Minister of Norway Gro Harlem Bruntland. She was all for conservation so long as it was outside the borders of Norway and did not involve Norwegian fishing vessels. This word popped up around the time of the U.N. Conference on the Environment and Development in 1992. What does it mean? After you strip away the spin and the green-washing it simply means: business as usual. For example' there a great deal of talk about the value of \"sustainable fisheries.\" In fact, practically every commercial fishery in the world is in a state of commercial collapse, yet we still find \"sustainably-fished\" cod or salmon, (at least it says so on the label).",
                "Another word is stocks. It sounds as if the ocean is our private warehouse. So we have fisheries that \"managethe stocks\" or the \"stocks have been reduced\", etc. The correct term is populations. We don't say there is an \"unhealthy stock of humans messing up the environment.\"",
                "When you put the three above-mentioned words together' you get the \"sustainable harvesting of stocks, humanely harvested' of course.\u2030",
                "Which bring us to the term humane as in \"humane killing.\" This term suggests that killing is acceptable so long as we can appease our guilt by making it sound okay by humanizing the action. This' of course' has led to the absurd description of the Canadian seal hunt or the Japanese dolphin slaughter as \"humane sustainable harvesting of stocks of seals/dolphins.\" Yet imagine the outrage if animal shelters put down dogs with a club instead of lethal injection.",
                "And finally the word conservative. It means 'to conserve', to maintain the status quo. When did Conservative come to mean undermining the Endangered Species Act or the Clean Air Act? When did conservative mean being anti-conservationist? As a conservationist, I've always viewed myself as a conservative but now I find that the right-wing, anti-conservationists who destroy forests' overfish the oceans' and pollute our rivers are calling themselves conservative and accusing me of being a radical for working to conserve nature and endangered species."

Oceanariums in southern Asia are paying top dollar for the few living dolphins \"harvested\" from the Japanese dolphin drive fisheries. Bad news upon bad news. With that prelude, I feel compelled to tell an equally distressing story that almost threads these separate scenes into quasi-coherent narrative.",
              "Twenty years ago, doing research for an Interspecies communication project with beluga whales unfolding in the Canadian High Arctic, I was shocked to learn that the northern Ocean gathers to itself much of the toxic PCBs, pesticides, and flame retardants being spewed into the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans from within Europe, North America and especially Russia. In those days I was still naive enough to believe that this huge and remote wilderness must be, and forever remain \"unspoiled\". After the fall of the Soviet Union, hundreds of military vessels from the Soviet nuclear fleet were systematically scuttled, energy source in situ, in the Barents Sea. Now, 15 years later, radioactivity is being measured in the livers of marine mammals all over the Arctic.",

Polar bears are thrust onto the screen to tell you that, now, or soon, or even yesterday, nowhere on Earth is remote enough to keep clean of the global defecator.",
              "What if global warming turns out to be just one tab of the great human imperception. Another tab begins with a story about orcas. The Northern tier of the species has attained a new status. They are the most toxic species on the planet. I am no longer naive enough to be surprised? Our cumulative smokestacks, large and small, have been exhausting material northward for the past century. Once the icecaps start melting, what other possible outcome could there possibly be for a species existing at the top of food chain?",
              "The toxicity of northern whales is a major (if much too inexplicit) talking point within the shouting chambers of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Japan shouts the loudest and with the most bluster, needing to promote the consumption of ever more whale meat for its huge population of seafood eaters in a world with ever-diminishing sea food. hear their shrill cry: we must take more whales! We need more all the time whales! A dirty whale is a clean whale whale, Every whale, so-many-they are-like-cockroaches whales any where we can find them whales! The Norwegians are capitalists with their own oil surpluses and a small stable population. They don't shout, but prefer to disengage from global discourse. Their whaling putsch is represented by genuinely scary-looking lobbyists who exude thuggish traditionalism. They like to think of themselves as on a smooth path to develop product for the Japanese market. Click the link to check out a recent story provided by Reuters describing their growth plan. Or if you don't have time to click, read this recent testimonial in praise of a local industry lobbyist. The boldface is the writer's own.",
              "This experienced diplomat thinks it has been clear since he left the whaling arena in 1993-94 that Norway would eventually win. Since then, Norway as a whaling nation has taken small steps in the right direction.",
              "So stop complaining. I can see that you are impatient. But there is much to be happy about. This was Klepsvik's message to the whalers. Klepsvik was not surprised about the gradual dissipation of resistance in the rest of the world. Everything has developed precisely as the Norwegian government has predicted. Because the reasons against our whaling were never based on fact, Klepsvik knew the feelings against whaling would cool off. .",
              "The biggest change occurred when the Americans placed themselves in the middle of the debate. They had to take their policy to the voters, and also make it jibe with their own whaling in Alaska. Under the table they decided that it was clear that they would not do anything against Norway, even if they in public announced that they did not like what Norway was doing. The threats from Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain did not count, because the USA, at least unofficially, was on Norway\u2019s side.",
              "It was also quite clear that Norway could not be hurt by American sanctions, which was the thing some in our government feared most. A report from the University of Trade showed that American boycotts are not effective in a country were there are ongoing sanctions against 300 different products all the time.",
              "How bad can I make it sound on this second day of the new year? Not too long ago, the Norwegian whaling industry negotiated the sale of many tons of Norwegian minke whale meat to Japan. Before it left port in Oslo, the entire shipment was seized by the Norwegian health department for exceeding Norway's toxicity standards for food export. Bizarrely, it was the Japanese importer who was most outraged by this seizure. Certainly, Japan has its own food standards. But they are sketchily enforced, and largely dependent on what good old boy network happens to be transacting the distribution. Check out our last month's newsletter for more on Japanese environmental and regulatory censorship.",
              "Rumor has it that the meat of those 100 minke whales was incinerated by Norway. And yet today, Norway continues to increase its catch quota. The meat is kept in deep freeze because of the lack of a market. The whalers are optimists, perhaps waiting for the future good news that their lobbyists have finally convinced Norwegian lawmakers to ease up on regulations forbidding the sale of poison meat. Be assured, if that ever happens, off to Japan it will go.",
              "Meanwhile, the Japanese have stepped up their efforts to target ever more Antarctic whales. Why? Because the deep DEEP south is the last place on Earth where enough toxic-free whales still reside. Otherwise, the whalers are out of business. Over this past month, Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd Society have mounted expeditions to confront Japanese whaling ships on the high seas off the Antarctic coast. Everyone who cares about whales should read about these encounters. The Greenpeace Story is here. The Sea Shepherd story is here."

The best mainstream account appears in the newspaper, Scotland on Sunday. Leader of the research team, David Lusseau, is clearly producing some of the best research in the social life of dolphins. Another one of his studies was picked up by the Discovery Channel under the intriguing title Dolphins as Networkers."

The software identified 'walk' and 'ball' barks better than people, although people identified 'play' and 'alone' barks better than the software. The program also identified which dog made which bark 52 percent of the time. Molnár and his colleagues had previously found that people can not reliably distinguish between individual Hungarian sheepdogs by their barks at all. \"I'm pretty sure this could work with any animal vocal signals,\" Molnár told LiveScience."

It did not start out this way. In the beginning I was taught by humans to control the dolphins through training techniques. It was in 2002 that I woke up. Through significant events such as taking our perceived control away, births and deaths and my openness to receive, the dolphins showed me a whole new way of being.  Its been 3 years since that experience and I am being continually drawn back to it to remember and then to create something new.  I am wanting to connect with dolphins and dolphin people again.  I am keen to be involved in dolphin interactions with all humans as \"therapy\" not only in special needs cases.",

During one slaughter, 8 juvenile dolphins were placed in a holding tank and eventually sold to oceanariums, including facilities in the USA and Europe. I read a report last year suggesting that the same practices are still operative today in the Japanese dolphin drive fisheries. Your last sentence suggests that these babies somehow let themselves be captured? Yikes!! Interspecies currently supports two campaigns to free orcas from US facilities. Our communication work focuses entirely on wild animals. They come to us when we put sound into the water. And they swim away when they lose interest."

              "(From the Nova Scotia Chronicle Herald)",
              "Researchers believe sonar can be blamed for strandings, in which distressed whales or dolphins drive themselves up on the shore. \"One of the things we’re very concerned about in the navy... is this issue of environmental stewardship,\" said Paul Hines, a physicist with Defence Research and Development Canada. \"We don’t want to do sea trials where there’s a risk of harming any marine mammals.\"",
              "To that end, the military is trying to come up with a mechanism that can detect and identify whales and dolphins. \"We basically said, ‘Let’s try and model how the human ear duct is, using some physics, and then we’ll apply it to this problem,’ \" Mr. Hines said. In musical terms, he’s trying to create a device that can recognize timbre — the same quality that allows people to distinguish a saxophone from a trumpet, even when they’re playing exactly the same notes. \"If I can hear the difference between those two sounds and I can recognize it, then I should be able to get my automatic classifier to recognize it as well,\" Mr. Hines said.",
              "Canadian warships conducting exercises normally post lookouts to spot whales and dolphins before using sonar or noisy weapons. \"Visual observation works only for some species.\" said Jim Theriault, a mathematician at Defence Research’s Dartmouth lab who works to mitigate the military’s acoustic effect on marine mammals. Sailors armed with underwater microphones can now listen for marine mammals. \"But the reality is that they get tired after a while,\" Mr. Theriault said. On the flip side, an automated system would never wear out, he said.",
              "Environmentalists have been watching the interplay between military sonar and marine mammals for more than a decade. A dozen Cuvier’s beaked whales beached themselves on the coast of Greece’s Kyparissiakos Gulf in May 1996 while sonar was being tested nearby during NATO naval exercises. In March 2000, at least 14 whales beached after NATO navies conducted anti-submarine exercises off the northern Bahamas. Eight of the mammals soon died, and specialists reported their ears had been badly damaged by loud sounds. \"They did some autopsies and they saw that there were some massive hemorrhages in their brains and in their ears,\" said Lindy Weilgart, a marine biologist at Dalhousie University who specializes in undersea noise. Sonar exercises conducted four years ago by the USS Shoup in Haro Strait, off Vancouver Island, corresponded to changes in behaviour by a pod of killer whales.",
              "\"The orcas behaved very unusually and looked very disturbed,\" Ms. Weilgart said. \"Some of the humans were saying they could hear it above water even a kilometre or so away. That’s pretty amazing because, for sound to transmit through the air-water barrier, it has to be very loud.\" Acoustic trauma caused by the exercises might also have contributed to the strandings and deaths of harbour porpoises.",
              "Recently, a US federal judge in Los Angeles barred the U.S. Navy from using high-powered sonar in training exercises off Southern California. The judge said lawyers had made a persuasive case that sonar could harm whales and other marine life. (editor's note: The Navy appealed, but lost. President Bush then responded, astonishingly, by simply exempting the US Navy from US environmental laws. The fact that Mr Bush has no actual legal standing to exempt the Navy from US law, is the basis of several pending lawsuits.)",
              "Asked about the new Canadian technology, Ms. Weilgart is keen, up to a point, about an automated system that would help the Canadian navy identify marine mammals. \"Some species are more vocal than others,\" Ms. Weilgart said, and vulnerable calves normally make less noise than adults. \"So there are still problems,\" she said. \"It’s not going to be a fail-safe system. But it’s worth doing if it’s effective.\" Canada is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the project.",
              "The technology may have other military applications. It might be possible for soldiers to use the same kind of mechanism on land as an automated sentry. \"It doesn’t fatigue or get distracted,\" Mr. Hines said. \"So potentially, you could apply these principles to a perimeter defence. Was that a cat or was it a burglar? You don’t want to be listening to the traditional bump in the night. You don’t want to have to raise your head every time there’s a howling wind.\""

              "January into February: It is the dark season here on my little island in the Pacific NorthWest. My smart friends save their pennies all Fall to escape this most dismal interlude of the year. Now, they have all scattered to the sunny climes of Mexico, Hawaii, and even cold Utah to rejuvenate themselves. My wife Katy and I remain pragmatic and committed this year to pay off the mortgage in this dangerous economy. We can't travel much of anywhere for very long. We settle instead, on a pleasant escapist route, sitting in front of a roaring wood stove each evening, playing cheerful old-timey songs on mandolin and banjo as if we've just stepped off the Fourth of July hayride. Better yet, two years ago we built a cedar sauna out in yard as an architectural alternative for winter. Three times a week we make our pilgrimage into the hot room, soaking the warmth deep into our bodies. With eyes closed, it's not especially hard to imagine we're lying on some beach with exotic birds cruising overhead. Open our eyes, open the sauna door, and we're immediately thrust back into the ignominious darkness where, over the past month, the temperature has barely fluctuated between two degrees above, and two degrees below freezing.",
              "February first is an important milestone in my year, the time I actually start to think about planting vegetables in four inch pots and then setting them on a heating pad to germinate. I do so around the middle of the month, focusing on the longest of long season crops: tomatoes, melons, eggplants. Writing to you, today, I do wish to share with you, all the hope that the act of planting engenders in me. My mind easily wanders to all the odd ways that a garden encompasses the interspecies relationship. Here's to you, my faithful readers, a reminder that you too, may be huddled around your computer in a well heated room; and... never forget...Spring is on the way.",
              "Why, indeed.",
              "The more I learn about my garden, the less objective I feel about it. Now that I can rattle off the Latin names and vital needs of so many of my own landscape plants, you might think I would regard them as botanical specimens, each possessed of a unique genetic recipe and species-specific traits. Call me sentimental: I think of them as friends.",
              "I’m no expert; not a professional gardener, and certainly not a botanist. I learned in the ninth grade that science mandates an emotional separation be maintained between observer and observed. If so, then what I do has little basis in science. I can be a keen observer, but not always an objective one. I treat gardening as a cooperative affair. I rather feel like a part of a neighborhood in which plants, animals, dirt, rocks and a human family all participate collectively in a love affair with place.",
              "Neither the language nor the forthright pragmatism of horticulture is able to plumb the depths of what I consider to be a mostly unspoken, intuitive relationship with the garden. My mind treats its own growing stockpile of horticultural information not as the basis of gardening but rather as a background hum to the more immediate aims of digging, wandering, smelling, enjoying, and critiquing.",
              "This confession also explains a hunch of mine: that the sentient garden is best written about in the first person. I believe the instincts that apprehend it turn tentative when clothed in the garb of dispassionate observation. There isn’t much objective to it, so why obfuscate its many insubstantial traits by falling upon a scientific jargon that does no better than transmute pure delight into an objective posture. We are all the heirs of this jargon, the innocent children of the reductionist idiom it represents.",
              "Look again. See that ornamental plum tree over there? That one’s a warrior. A survivor. An interspecies communicator. Or look at these cabbages. They are the gift-givers. Sentient beings possessed of a shy and humble integrity. The fox who visits here most nights, on its search for rodents, knows of what I speak."

              "\"Whale Meat Glut a Problem for Japan\"",
              "by HIROKO TABUCHI, Associated Press, Tokyo, Thursday Feb 9, 2006",
              "Japan has enticed children with whale burger school lunches, sung the praises of the red meat in colorful pamphlets, and declared whale hunting \"a national heritage.\" But Tokyo has a dilemma: by rapidly expanding its whale hunt, Japan now kills more of the giant mammals than its consumers care to eat. The result is an unprecedented glut of whale meat. Prices - once about $15 a pound - are plunging, inventories are bursting, and promoters are scrambling to get Japanese to eat more whale.",
              "It's a tough sell. \"To put it simply, whale meat tastes horrible,\" said 30-year-old Kosuke Nakamura, one of the diners at a Hana No Mai restaurant in Tokyo who turned their noses up at whale meat. Young people are put off by the tough, pungent meat, Nakamura said, while older Japanese are reminded of the lean years after the country's defeat in World War II.",
              "And while few Japanese voice environmental concerns over hunting whales, some younger people say it has brought the country unfavorable publicity. \"Whaling's so bad for Japan's image. I don't know why we still hunt,\" Nakamura said.",
              "Some 1,035 tons of whale meat hit the market in Japan last year, a 65percent increase from 1995, the Fisheries Agency says. And sluggish demand means inventories have almost doubled in five years to 2,704 tons in 2004. In the same period, the average price of whale fell almost 30 percent, to just over $10 a pound in 2004. That's more than the average price for beef - about $9 a pound - and far higher than for chicken or pork.",
              "But the glut of whale meat hasn't stopped the harpoon guns. Tokyo plans to kill - under a research program - some 1,070 minke whales in 2006, over 400 more than last year. Japan will also hunt 10 fin whales, and a total of 160 Bryde's, sei and sperm whales, fisheries official Kenji Masuda said.",
              "The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986, approving limited hunts for research purposes a year later. Opponents have called Japan's hunts merely a way for it to dodge the whaling ban. Tokyo says its program is needed to establish reliable information on whale populations and habits - data Japan says can only be gleaned by killing the animals. The government, which distributes the meat and uses profits to fund research, is working to promote whale meat and secure new distribution channels.",
              "\"Is it OK to eat whale meat? Of course it is,\" reads a pamphlet titled \"Delicious Whales\" that is distributed by the government-affiliated Japan Whaling Association. \"Even if we capture 2,000 whales a year for 100 years, it's OK because whale numbers are growing,\" the pamphlet says. The association acknowledges whale is a hard sell. The meat was considered a rich source of protein in the lean years after World War II, but people moved on to other meats - notably beef - as they became more affluent.",
              "Some local governments have begun offering whale meat in school lunches. Wakayama, a prefecture with a whale-hunting tradition 280 miles southwest of Tokyo, has been aggressive in getting youngsters to eat whale, introducing whale meals at 270 public schools in 2005. Nutritionists have even developed child-friendly whale dishes, including whale meatballs, hamburgers and whale spaghetti bolognese, said Tetsuji",

              "Chimney Co., which runs the Hana No Mai eateries, acknowledges customers are wary of new whale dishes. Still, Hana No Mai will keep selling whale meat. And a trader at one of Tsukiji market's biggest wholesalers, Daito Gyorui Co., was equally optimistic. \"The fall in prices is a good thing because it will make whale meat more accessible,\" Yoshiaki Kochi said. \"Japanese will never forget the taste of whale. It's part of our culture. It's in our DNA.\""

              "by Douglas Heingartner for the NY Times.",
              "A $139 device, called \"the BowLingual\" is a dog collar equipped with a wireless microphone that records a pet's barks, interprets them as emotions and transmits them as text messages like \"I'm bored, let's play.\". Takara, its Japanese manufacturer claims the device \"comes a step closer to realizing everyone's childhood dream of conversing with their pet.",
              "Though it all sounds very Dr. Dolittle, animal researchers have in fact been using voice-recognition technology for decades. The BowLingual's developer says its technology is based on 2,000 voiceprints from roughly a thousand dogs. And it turns out that the utterances of many species can be analyzed and identified using many of the same techniques that have allowed human voice recognition to make the leap from high-tech novelty to valuable application.",
              "In Braunschweig, Germany, for example, researchers at the Institute of Technology and Biosystems Engineering have recently been able to decipher, with about 90 percent accuracy, what cows mean when they moo: hunger, thirst, need for milking and so on.",
              "Dr. Gerhard Jahns, a control engineer who helped devise the project, said that about 700 \"vocalizations\" were recorded from about 20 cows, a process he described as \"extremely time-consuming.\" The system records the moos and scans them for specific tonal frequencies or aberrations: a cough at a certain pitch, for example, might indicate that Bessie is coming down with the flu. Dr. Jahns stressed, however, that the goal was \"information, and not diagnosis\" of the animals; it is ultimately up to the farmer to decide what to do.",
              "Wojtek Kowalczyk, a professor at the Free University in Amsterdam who helped develop the project's software, said there was a big demand for such a system, although he estimated that wide-scale deployment was still three to five years away. Surprisingly, he said, the system's most commercially attractive feature is its ability to recognize estrus, or the period when the animal is in heat, which may last only a few hours. To make any such system practical, it has to be able to recognize unfamiliar voices. So-called \"speaker independent\" recognition is difficult for any voice application, as anyone who has tussled with a voice-based telephone directory knows too well. Professor Kowalczyk said that theoretically, this should be much easier to achieve with animals. Most of their vocabularies, or \"repertoires,\" are smaller; the cow system, for example, recognizes about a dozen vocalizations.",
              "But in practice the situation is quite different, he said, because the meaning of the source material ultimately remains elusive: \"How can we know what a cow wanted to say?\" Animal physiologists try to deduce the answer by imposing specific conditions: not milking a cow for a long period, for example, will increase the likelihood that a moo emitted under those circumstances means \"I want to be milked.\" As the database of vocalizations expands, the results will improve.",
              "Indeed, that computers have become so fast and cheap has been pivotal to this kind of research. \"None of my current work could have existed even 18 months ago,\" said Jim Nollman, founder of a nonprofit organization called Interspecies Communication, who has worked on voice recognition for whales. \"It's ironic and self-defeating that the study of whale sounds has been developing for 20 years using equipment that only records one-tenth of the frequency spectrum some of these species use.\"",
              "That is partly a result of the limited hearing range of human beings: human ears peak out at frequencies of around 22 kilohertz. Many animals, however, communicate at levels well above this (or below it, in the case of elephants, for example). Recording just one second of 100-kilohertz sound, a common frequency among marine mammals, takes a megabyte; an all-day field recording, then, requires serious drive space.",
              "These ultra-hi-fi recordings have helped reveal that the meaning of animal language is often generated not by the sounds themselves but rather by the way those sounds are modulated. A second of whale song, for example, contains thousands of Morse-code-like beats that whales use to communicate. And many birds seem to have a vocabulary of basically one call, which takes on different meanings based on its frequency or volume. \"It's not syntax per se, but sequence,'' said Brenda McCowan, an assistant professor at the Veterinary Medicine Teaching and Research Center at the University of California at Davis.",
              "Dan Weary, a professor of animal welfare at the University of British Columbia, has used this knowledge of context to interpret pig calls. The pitch of a piglet's squeal, for instance, has been correlated with pain when it crosses the one-kilohertz threshold. This knowledge might allow farmers to prevent outbursts of tail-biting, in which frenzied piglets can wind up killing each other. If the software detects a certain number of piglets emitting very high-pitched squeals at the same time, it can automatically send the farmer a warning.",
              "The BowLingual has put off its American debut, mainly because of legal obstacles rather than economic ones. The device could, after all, misinterpret a menacing mood. \"If the dog tries to bite a kid,'' Mr. Oda said, \"then that could be difficult\" as a liability issue in the United States - a consideration absent in Japan's less litigious culture."

              "Researchers at MIT have now mathematically confirmed that humpback whales have their own syntax that uses sound units to build phrases that can be combined to form songs that last for hours. Until now, only humans have demonstrated the ability to use such a hierarchical structure of communication. The research, published online in the March 2006 issue of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, offers a new approach to studying animal communication, although the authors do not claim that humpback whale songs meet the linguistic rigor necessary for a true language.",
              "“Humpback songs are not like human language, but elements of language are seen in their songs.\" commented the principal researcher, Ryuji Suzuki, a predoctoral fellow in neuroscience. \"With limited sight and sense of smell in water, marine mammals are more dependent on sound—which travels four times faster in water than air—to communicate.\"",
              "For six months each year, all male humpback whales in a population sing the same song during mating season. Thought to attract females, the song evolves over time. Suzuki and co-authors John Buck and Peter Tyack applied the tools of information theory to analyze the complex patterns of moans, cries, and chirps in the whales' songs for clues to the information being conveyed."

              "A month ago, she had spent nine hours one long day hunched over a sink in a high school lavatory, her arms immersed up to the elbows in warm soapy water, fingers lathering a mound of wriggling feathers and akimbo wings, eyes on guard against a quick jab from a razor sharp beak. She cooed sweet nothings into the ears of cormorants and oystercatchers that shivered on the edge of shock until she finally lost her voice. The air had resounded so constantly with harsh shrieks and feeble mewing that now she’s hearing bird calls in her dreams. In these days of such ecological uncertainty, I  have come to regard  my friend as an apt candidate for sainthood. Saint Francis and Mother Theresa hovering over adjacent sinks on either side of her.",

              "She lowers her gaze to remark that bird washers are scapegoats for what can kindly be described as the public’s limited attention span. Every year, devastating environmental catastrophes occur ever more often, constantly forcing us to redefine our concept of the inconceivable. Significant oil spills occur two or three  times every month in US coastal waters, and yet they rarely make the news unless the amount spilled or the resultant havoc sets some new dubious record. Add to that, the fact that the Media must tailor its coverage to keep its viewing audience from switching the channel. News focusing on her own network of volunteers, “people who make a difference”, inevitably pre-empts reportage of any long term efforts to protect wildlife before the animals get in trouble.",
              "Wildlife managers naturally feel discouraged, objecting to what they perceive as false hope: the overly simplistic message that we can heal nature, one bird at a time. The bad news is that the clout of TV coverage occasionally deflects limited funds away from long term management programs and toward efforts like hers, to save a few hundred birds representing mostly common species. Volunteers spend half an hour tending a single bird that is likely to die of shock the following day.",
              "My friend does acknowledge the deceptive happy ending inferred by her onscreen presence. But she surprises me to wish out loud that her powers of pre-emption were even more sweeping than they are. In her estimation, washing birds is not a naive version of sensible management practices. It is, rather, the direct action of people who care deeply enough to give freely of their own time and money because they yearn to participate in the healing of nature.  Nor does her endeavor emphatically espouse a political point of view. It demonstrates compassion, and not just for the seabirds trembling between her fingers, but also for the tanker captains who provide the gasoline she relies on to drive out to the coast. In her view, the vital issue of environmental protection is too personal, and too important, to be left to the plans and proposals of managers, economists, scientists, and oil company executives. The degradation is very intense when it is felt as the real sensation of crude oil sticking to feathers. And it is intensifying. The prevailing management schemes have failed.",
              "She stares at me thoughtfully, then throws out something that she knows I wrote about in my first book: that language informs perception. As she understands it, the environmental crisis is a crisis in perception. Transforming perceptions is not only the most important, but also the most overlooked aspect of our search for lasting environmental solutions.",
              "The mainstream search for answers is mainly undertaken by scientists who, in her words, \"rely too much on objectivity to get us to the place we need to be\". To her mind, objectivity promotes a systemic distancing that transmutes the environmental crisis into a discrete object that is, somehow, apart from ourselves. And because the prevailing solutions are all built on this most fundamental aspect of the scientific method, the rest of us, the nonscientists, are left to feel either disempowered or exempt, to change things on their own. The individual’s responsibility remains vague, because the prevailing model saps our resolve to become more fully engaged.",
              "I sigh, smile, then propose to her that objectivity may be the best way we have to perceive, let alone solve problems so vast as to make the individual’s relationship to nature seem abstract, if not meaningless.",
              "She takes a sip of ice tea, then leans forward in her chair to emphasize that it’s the deeper context, not the judging of the scientific method that interests her. Yes, certainly, the environment requires more, better trained managers to deal with accelerating damage. But likewise, we need an overarching strategy that refocuses our understanding of how individual perception harms nature. To get to the place we need to be, we first need to divest the tacticians and managers of their counterproductive authority to keep the rest of us disengaged and unconnected.",
              "I blow air across my lips to signal that this conversation makes me feel oddly disoriented. Although her perceptual premise makes good sense to me on a gut level, my mind automatically dismisses it as both naïve and provocative.",
              "She points out that cultural shifts in perception are not so uncommon. Just in the past ten years, the internet has drastically altered our perception of community. Her face softens as she adds, \"Not only is it possible, but certain, that I am changing the human relationship to nature one bird at a time.",
              "Her gaze has roused in me a dull ache as I comprehend a world where the cumulative activities of six billion human beings are impacting everything, everywhere, all the time. My shrugging shoulders prompt her to drive the knife deeper. \"Too many people seem to be fulfilled by backpacking, whale-watching, fishing, activities that let them partake of nature, but giving no opportunity to give back. They are quite different things.\"",
              "As my sandwich arrives, I remark that sometimes it seems so hopeless.",
              "She makes a thorough examination of her own Waldorf salad, then shakes her head to remark that there is hope. New metaphors and stories are emerging to help diminish the chronic distancing. \"On this last trip, I was sitting on the high school steps, holding a paper towel on my arm to stench a gash administered by a guillemot’s beak. A government ornithologist sat down beside me, and praised all of us volunteers for giving so much to future generations.\" I lift an eyebrow. She flashes a dazzling smile. \"Can you imagine TV reporters tailoring the news for a public attention span measured by generations?\"",
              "Her voice turns earnest to delve a little deeper into the symbolism of her act. \"Volunteers wash birds, not because they want other people to regard them as virtuous, but because they perceive wildlife as an extension of themselves.\" It has always seemed obvious to me, that we act connected when we feel connected? So my friend keeps traveling out to the Coast, any coast, doing what she can, all she can, to bear constant witness to her own perception of bonding. By doing so, maybe she also keeps the ember burning inside you and me.",
              "She stands, wagging her fingers to signal that it is time for her to go. She grabs the check before I can protest, turns to walk away, then looks over her shoulder to gaze at me. “Next time there’s a spill, I’ll give you a call. We can drive out together.”",
              "Her invitation takes me by surprise. The idea had never occurred to me. I grunt in response, knowing full well that I am avoiding a clear yes or a clear no. \"So it's a yes\", then, is it? Before I can answer, she is gone.",

              "Is our video supply bottomless? I have been noticing lately that the old routine of turning on the TV, and spending a futile 15 minutes searching in vain for something (anything) that wasn't inane, sleazy, or gluttonous, has lately been replaced by the activity of pulling out my wireless MacBook laptop, and watching YouTube. I spent an hour the other night, mandolin in hand, watching at least 10 different videos, all of which focused on closeups of mandolin player's fingers playing the same two fiddle tunes, I was then trying to learn. Another night, I only watched rare whale species shot out on the open ocean by non-scientists. Put in a greater context, this alteration in the evening routine is probably being played out across America, and thus signals the end of non-PBS network TV. Here's a few things I definitely recommend you watch.",

The Letterman version focuses on how SeaWorld might have punished the whale. \"Seaworld. Don't screw with us\". But then take the basic issue a step further, and watch the actual incident filmed by a person in the crowd. Or yet another one from a person in the crowd on another day, when Shamu soaks most of the audience. Believe me such a soaking is not in the training regimen. If you've never been to such a show, but you've have heard some of the accounts about SeaWorld's over-the-top sense of entitlement to these orcas as property, you could easily watch more variations on this theme for well over an hour. At some point, you owe to yourself to watch a video by the eco-opposition, for example, this \"trailer\" about freeing a captive orca named Corky. And finally, end your tour of the captive orca hot-button issue, by visiting the \"free Corky\" website, which straightforwardly presents all the stats and media you'll ever need to make up your own mind if this an activity that the human race ought to be pursuing in the 21 century. The site also presents some ways you can get involved to help put an end to this interspecies disgrace. But wait...there's one more movie you've just got to see. To illuminate the poetry of conflicting philosophies at play in this issue, watch this poorly shot video of a barking dog on a moving fishing boat getting kissed by a wild orca.",
              "Whale sonar remains such a deep well, that we can barely conceive how the animals use it to perceive their world. They not only perceive objects, but also perceive within those objects, much like x-rays. They not only perceive objects, but probably use the echoes of specific objects as the basis of a cetacean language. In some cases, a species' echolocation frequency wave length is focused magnificently on the actual length of the animal's prey. A major reason that squid-eating pilot whales echolocate so differently than squid-eating beaked whales, is largely a function of the vast difference in hunting method, plus the actual size of the squid that they hunt. And last month we learned, in a new study, that many whale species have sonar systems that send out two pings at once, allowing them to detect underwater objects with an accuracy far beyond the most sophisticated human technologies. These two \"pings' are timed so closely together, that until this latest high-tech test, humans had been unable to measure them as anything but a single click. An earlier study, focusing on cachalot (sperm whale) echolocation, concluded that the actual placement of the hydrophones is critical to whether we can hear a click as a one ping or two. That's because the whales transmit it in such a tight beam that they focus through an acoustic lens within their head. No matter how they modulate it, the duration remains so short, that the ability of researchers to record one or two pings depends entirely upon the sensor's placement within the beam. A Spanish team, led by whale visionary Michel Andre, is now researching something even more edgy, called \"ambient light\" which, almost beyond belief, lets one whale \"see\" precisely what another whale's clicking has illuminated. The cachalot achieve this by sensing how the ocean's constant background noise is altered ever-so-slightly by the \"shadow\" of an object or animal that passes between the other whale's click and its own ears. Dr. Andre is now developing a computer model that will essentially copy this sci-fi ability of whales, with plans to use the technology to protect the same whales. If even a fraction of the whales in an area are vocalizing, the technology will acoustically sense all of them. For instance, a ship passing through a whale-dense area will be able to see all the whales, and thus be able to avoid striking any of them.",

              "Before the traditional Iroquois convened their consul meetings, they invoked this declaration:",
              "In our every deliberation we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations.",
              "Each subsequent vote included a ballot cast by a representative who spoke specifically for the needs, the survival, and the dignity of those who would live a hundred and fifty years in the future. For the Iroquois, the generational format of their council defined a longterm relationship between government and ecology. The rights of future generations never became an issue of policy because it was, instead, the context of policy. Conservation was the bedrock upon which their government was built. The medium was the message.",
              "Today, we have no political mechanism to debate genetic engineering, or even no-brainers like excessive product packaging. We are saddled, instead to abstract tenets such as \"progress\", and these tenets render us deaf to anyone who would speak intuitively for the rights and needs of future generations. One might well wonder how the future would be different if we started electing politicians possessed of better hearing.",
              "Knowledge or Wisdom",
              "Whereas wildness was central to the Iroquois' daily perception of the world, it is reduced to the margins of our own lives. We have little memory of what it is we have lost. Because language reflects perception, we are able to locate faint signs of this perceptual loss in our language. We often rely, for instance, on the term \"natural resources\" as if it were synonymous with nature and wildness. The prevailing educational system instructs our children in great depth how to observe nature, while it teaches almost nothing about nurturing a sense of communion with nature. The semantics of the distinction are telling. Observing suggests standing outside looking in. Communion signifies a conscious linkage.",
              "Language not only reflects perception, it reflects public policy as well. Such a connection may explain the origination of wilderness policies molded by men of power who get their information from data sheets often compiled by vested interests, and who debate the future of nature and animals inside cavernous artificially-lit halls within an urban environment. These are well-educated people who, just like the rest of us, have been taught that nature is an observable resource needing to be managed. Their education taught them well to regard the human relationship to nature as a body of quantifiable information.",
              "Is that what nature is: data? Echoes reverberate through the halls of congress assuring us in a self-assured language that, no, certainly not. Everyone knows what nature is. Right? But data about natural resources is the best packaging we have to determine wilderness legislation.",
              "How else could we do it? Anyone have a better idea? Actually, somebody possessed of a different language that mirrors a different perception of nature — Hopis or Tibetans — might make the observation that our need to gather data is always going to reflect a parallel need to exploit that data. Or expressed more obliquely: knowledge is power but not necessarily wisdom.",
              "The legislator's data sheet is prepared by biologists whose own perceptions about nature are formed by the same educational and cultural mores as the rest of us. Their data may be objective, the most certain criteria at our disposal for mining truth. Whether this so-called truth reflects nature, remains far from certain.",
              "Policy reflects science reflects culture reflects language reflects perception reflects in a circle back to policy. Each spoke of this wheel influences every spoke. The wheel also suggests that our culture's much-applauded objectivity actually reflects a point of view—a relative or cultural truth—but never an absolute truth. How is that? Even as data arbitrates our view of natural resources, it casts a fog over our dwindling capability to know what it means to be a part of nature. This culture of ours assigns much utilitarian value to its numbers, its resources, and too little value to the idea that nature might possess some inherent value apart from ourselves.",
              "Our data-driven politics is prone to capriciousness. It ceases to exist the moment our attention flies to some other compartmentalized issue: Iraq, the economy, space, technology. Where did nature vanish to, you may ask? This answer is this. It is hiding outside ourselves. Our modern minds have never learned to register nature as the context of our lives. Pragmatists assert that this compartmentalization is the only way the culture can sustain itself.",
              "How else could the economy appear to grow strong while nature is everywhere in full retreat?",
              "Government policy overwhelmingly reflects the nature compartment . Senators call it un-authoritative, impractical, or simply impossible to legislate ecological policy guided, not by data, but by relationship, morality, or a sense of place. These people are not easily moved when an earnest non-expert rises up from the throng to deliver an emotional harangue that declares, for instance that fisheries policy is simply wrongheaded because it is causing the sea turtles to go extinct. \"If it's wrong,\"declare the legislators in response, \"Show us the data that proves it?\" This prompts an industry spokesperson to demonstrate that experts can, indeed, place a dollar value on disappearing turtles. Employing a lethal dose of legal terminology, they can show that this value is of a lesser amount than the value of the shrimp industry left to fish unimpeded by impractical netting methodology that does not entrap turtles.",
              "Something is amiss when those possessed of the talent to \"prove it\" use that proof and that talent to implement policies that prompt the aerial shooting of wolves, the virtual annihilation of pelagic dolphins in the cause of pet food, the nuclear stockpile. Global warming. Sadly, such horrors will continue to unfold as long as legislators remain unwilling to acknowledge their inability to govern a nature that is not a synonym for natural resources. Yet no time soon will they acknowledge that the expert who steps forward is, almost always, no expert at all. He's another well paid lackey for business as usual.",
              "Linkage and Linkage",
              "Now we are told that the science of ecology, said to illuminate the linkage inherent within nature, will alter the current perception of business as usual. But whose ecology is it? Does it define the science of linkage? Or does it motivate the experience of linkage? Recognizing the difference provides a clue about the welfare of future generations.",
              "The first term reflects that same data-driven relationship to nature. Biologists point their feelers outward. They do so in order to accumulate data that describes a linkage that exists outside their own perceptions. Yet precisely because they work so hard to maintain this separation, biologists will never be able to make the environmental crisis go away. They exhaust too much of their own genius retaining an aloof neutrality. Even Many ecologists display a deep passion to preserve the environment. yet those are the ones who suffer the most. When they argue their case before the legislators who govern policy, they soon discover that their passion destroys their authority.",
              "By contrast, we live inside the second, experiential definition of ecology. The experience of linkage includes our perceptions, our feelings, intuitions, responsibilities, and hopefully our right relation to nature. There is nothing much objective about this second definition, which explains why it doesn't make for much of a science. A case could be made that the experience of linkage actually refutes objectivity. In some odd way, the science of ecology is best understood as an oxymoron.",
              "Yet so many ecologists care so deeply about the environment that one might wonder if there could be a new kind of science not shackled to the objective pose; a new kind of science not driven by data. Human beings are not born with a natural predilection to destroy nature. Nor does the destruction occur independent of human intentionality. As the concept of the seventh generation is meant to demonstrate, the environmental crisis is something we are taught to perceive.",
              "Our cultural training is a kind of psychosis. Many environmental writers have pointed out that our global resource dependency is an addiction. Gar Smith, writing for Earth Island Journal, once described the Exxon Valdez oil spill this way:",
              "Oil company officials are beginning to sound like problem drinkers who continue making promises they can't keep...Oil-hauling, like alcoholism is a form of addictive behavior that is inevitably destructive.",
              "The environmental crisis is a crisis of perception. It begins and ends inside each one of us. Retaining the separation between subject and object exacerbates the problem. We act connected when we get connected. Our actions, our lifestyle, our policies all follow. Paraphrasing the Buddhist concept of the Boddhisattava, no one is cured until everyone is cured.",
              "Imagine a future in which the de facto authority our society presently grants to scientists to describe nature and, in fact, speak on nature's behalf, is granted, instead, to ethicists, musicians, dancers, poets, shamans, even children. What all these seemingly disparate people share in common is a deep subjective trust of life and linkage. These are people who give real power to intuition. Let's choose artists who grant imagery more authority than data, and comprehend the key difference between nature and natural resources. These are people who possess a perceptual grasp about the abiding unity of nature. Unlike many politicians and all scientists, they do not attempt to stand outs comprehend the key difference between nature and natural resources.",
              "I am suggesting that the culture's relationship to nature will improve on the day that Senate subcommittees about land use start consulting our best dreamers as wisemen and wise-women and elevate them to the critical position currently occupied by the technocrats: that of defining and explaining nature for the rest of us. Ironically, Western culture may be unique in not doing so. Future generations suffer because of it.",
              "Everything about our culture recommends that the seventh generation does not exist. I would suggest, instead, that they are real people. They do exist. Yet for the moment, they remain incapable of doing much of anything on their own behalf. They remain seated along the temporal sidelines, as it were, holding their collective breath, waiting in anticipation, watching how our future (yours and mine) is going to transmute into their present. Perhaps we can give them more substance by changing the way we perceive them.",
              "Take a perceptual leap. Can you hear them? Listen closely. Their call is not much more than a low pulse, like the background hum of the big bang, or perhaps our own cumulative heartbeat. The seventh generation is singing its quiet song just about everywhere these days. Teach yourself how to listen. Teach a friend. Teach an enemy.",
              "In the process of blueprinting our own American system of government, Thomas Jefferson drew inspiration from the Iroquois' representational democracy. It makes one wonder about things that might have been. For example, had Jefferson written the rights of future generations into the U.S. bill of rights, would we, now living ten generations later, still be dependent upon non-renewable fossil fuels which causes global warming? And imagine what life would be like today if, a hundred years ago, we had set in place a public mechanism to test the ecological value of the automobile or, fifty years ago, the social value of the television set. But there was no debate. Unlike the Iroquois, our parents and our great-grandparents had no public mechanism that spoke to the longterm effects of their inventions."

              "A number of scientific papers on animal language, as well on the origins of human writing, have found their way into the mainstream media this past month. Oddly, some of the most publicized \"breakthroughs\" are essentially trivial refinements of ideas that have been generally understood for many years. For example, MSNBC recently ran a front page story with this headline: Writing traced to nature, ancient shapes. The article argues that the letter L displays a corner. Since our lives are full of corners, the corner evolved to became the letter L because it was an easy form for our eyes to distinguish. Wouldn't a 50 year old Encyclopedia entry for \"alphabet\" provide much the same information? This latest research argues that the so-called breakthrough is the emphasis on easy reading, as opposed to previous research that concluded that humans chose the L form because it was easy to write. Of course this argument loses all power to persuade when we acknowledge that 50% of the human race employs a form of writing based on complex ideograms?",
              "Another well-publicized scientific paper demonstrates that dolphins vocalize names for all the members of a pod. These names are called signature whistles. But where's the news? I learned this key fact about dolphin language by reading John Lilly in the 1970s. In my own book, The Charged Border, (just published in a German edition by AT Verlag), I wrote about dolphins and beluga whales initiating every conversation with a signature whistle. These highly social animals live in the ocean where sight distance is limited. They developed signatures to comprehend which animal is verbalizing at any single moment. In certain species, each individual in a pod enunciates his or her unique signature at the start of every vocalization. Distinguished cetacean researcher, Michel Andre, has observed the same grammatical structure in cachalot communication. Because cachalot language consists almost entirely of poly-rhythmic clicks, an African drummer on Andre's staff, was the first person to ID individual whales only by listening to the click patterns received by hydrophones dangling off their research vessel. In truth, researchers should — but are not, yet — referring to signatures as one aspect of the grammar of a complex toothed whale language.",
              "The revolutionary idea of a non-human grammar appears in this recent headline from National Geographic Online: Monkeys Use \"Sentences,\" Study Suggests. Back in the 1970's, biologists discovered that African vervet monkeys employ unique alarm calls for three predators: eagle, snake, and leopard. Calling \"eagle\" prompts the troop to scamper for the ground, while snake causes the opposite effect. The new study hypothesizes that a cousin to the vervet, known as the putty-faced monkey, stitches these separate alarm calls together to create entirely new meaning. \"Pyow\" is their alarm call for leopard. \"Hack\" alerts them to an eagle hovering above. By ingeniously playing a recording of \"Pyow-hack\" together, the researchers determined that the complex message took on a new shade of meaning, essentially, \"let's get out of this place, quicker than we ordinarily would if it was just one or the other\". But I see no logical justification to reach this conclusion. If there was a leopard climbing from below, and an eagle hovering above, then neither ground not treetop would solve the usual exit strategy. I for one, wish the researchers had first transmitted \"pyow-hack\", and then followed it up a few day's later by transmitting \"hack-pyow.\" if the response remained the same, then we may conclude that the double call is not a sentence, but a monkeys version of being caught between a rock and a hard place.",
              "Easily the most profound animal study of the past few months made no mainstream headlines. It was an incident documented by Scott Veirs of San Juan Island working under the BeamReach project. Veirs describes, with narrative flair, the rare orca \"greeting ceremony\" which has been observed for years in Puget Sound. The BeamReach website presents us with a beautiful video of one such ceremony that occurred in 2005. So what's new about an orca behavior that's been observed for years? After reading Veirs account, you may well ponder as I did: when was the last time you heard a Ph.D zoologist discussing any animal behavior as a \"ceremony\". And there is something profound to ponder. Veirs' documented event was the last time any of the researchers saw the old matriarch of the pod. It is generally agreed, that the elder died within a few days afterwards. Veirs takes a giant step into the future of animal behavior studies when he concludes: \"Could we have witnessed a \"goodbye\" ceremony?\" With his vivid description of foraging going on all around the whales as they formed a line, the event begins to sound a bit like the whale's version of a testimonial dinner held for a much-beloved, and terminally ill auntie.",

A dingo is one thing. Music made with a grain silo is something else. OR dig even deeper and hear music made with a cactus instrument.

          "content": [
              "During the summer of 2005, Interspecies.com helped design a “living whale” tent pavilion for EXPO, the international technology fair that was being held that year in Nagoya Japan. This multimedia exhibit showcased interspecies’ merger of music, science, and environmental education. Our co-producer and sponsor was ICERC, Japan’s foremost whale and dolphin NGO. During one Sunday that hot August, our “living whale pavilion” hosted 100,000 visitors. 98% were Japanese. Over half were children.",
              "The centerpiece of this exhibit was a computer kiosk called \"the WhaleSinger\", a musical instrument designed by Interspecies.com and programmed by Native Instruments of Berlin Germany to demonstrate the endangered status of several cetacean species by engaging children to play with various whale sounds to create their own music. Pressing notes on a piano keyboard triggered both a picture and audio from 15 different species. Other keys looped and layered these calls to create melodies and rhythms. The Whalesinger was bulleted by Japanese media as an essential EXPO sight. The coverage was gratifying, given the fact that EXPO included 500 national and corporate pavilions. One reporter claimed that our Whalesinger pavilion drew more visitors than the US pavilion.",
              "Japan EXPO's theme was innovative technology and environmental education as the best tools to help our children build a better world by protecting nature. Everywhere you looked were indications that the Japanese regarded themselves as the leaders, designers, and architects of our planet’s ecological future. The flanks of the hill upon which EXPO was built, were covered by the largest array of solar panels ever built. Yet all the effusive signage actually made me acutely aware of the fact that Japan is not yet ready to shed its characterization as a destroyer of nature. It cannot shed this image until it stops killing whales and dolphins.",
              "Every Westerner who has ever promoted cetacean protection within Japan, must eventually become aware of the extent that the Japanese  government and media collaborate to censor information from abroad that condemns whaling. The result is an utter lack of public discussion within Japan about the corrupt ethics of whaling, or of the relentless protest within the international community.",
              "How bad is it? A week before I flew to Japan, a collective of  Western ecology groups had produced huge demonstrations at several Japanese embassies around the world attempting to publicize the dolphin drive fisheries. And at EXPO, I had the pleasure to work alongside some of Japan’s most prominent wildlife and habitat ecologists. Not one of these ecologists knew about the protest. They all became visibly embarrassed when I asked if they would support such a global protest.",
              "This embarrassment is chronic, and its response is often absurd. For a foreigner to ask questions about the Japanese whale-killing juggernaut, is often to dredge up the analogy of an American animal rights activist lobbying against beef consumption in a ranching state. It is a poor analogy. The whaling industry is run by a very small group of men whose wild and endangered “product” provides food for a minuscule percentage of Japanese people. Plus, their industry is condemned almost everywhere in the world outside Japan.",
              "For some years now, I have been aware that my own pro-whale work is “acceptable” by Japanese media standards. I easily make it past the covert censors mostly because my message is for whale intelligence with an unmistakable focus on meeting the living animals themselves. It has never been anti-whaling. After 15 trips to Japan since 1978 focusing on cetacean issues, and with well over 100 interviews in Japanese newspapers, radio, and TV, I may be the only Western cetacean promoter that most Japanese people have ever heard of.",
              "Some western anti-whaling groups are run by lawyers and/or biologists. These groups mostly operate outside of the public’s gaze. They are focused on lobbying against Japanese whaling at the governmental level, especially in the halls of the International Whaling Commission and IUCN. The work is crucial, although entirely tactical. These groups rarely provide funds or produce programs to loosen the tight grip of the whaling hegemony within Japan.",
              "Many more western anti-whaling groups focus on protest. Protest can be a powerful political and social tool when it directly engages people in the street. It creates community, with the objective of granting like-minded people a legitimate outlet to express their discontent. A successful protest will spread the story of this discontent, and if the outreach is well-designed in advance, it can achieve the important goal of eliciting more discussion, and asserting pressure on the people who control bad policy. But it can only work if, first, the story spreads to the place where change is actually needed, and second, if the controlling interests of that place are eventually impacted by those pressing for change. Protest too often oversimplifies complex issues, making complex gray issues appear black and white.",
              "Do you dutifully send in your money in support of brand-name groups whose perennial protests make big news in London, and Los Angeles and Sydney? If so, you must ask yourself: what purpose does an anti-whaling protest held in New York City or London actually serve if the crucial message is never heard inside Japan?",
              "I feel a bit uneasy to conclude that today, these protests serve primarily as fundraising events in support of next year’s protest/fundraising event. Over time, they have transmuted from a valid means to educate the general public of the USA and Europe about whaling issues, into self-perpetuating institutions that are used to support the large nonprofit bureaucracies that have come to rely on them for their own survival. Although I will not disparage the emotion of feeling good in support of whale protection, your money is certainly not having the effect you hoped for. The Japanese do not hear about these events. They never have. The protest organizer's dream of awakening the Japanese public to anti-whaling activism cannot manifest within a vacuum. Worse still, 30 years of unsuccessful protests against Japanese whaling have accrued a different cumulative message than the message of any single protest. Taken together, they insinuate a negative opinion of the Japanese people for never heeding the message. The fact is, the Japanese public is not getting your message.",
              "However, they are getting a different message. In Tokyo, the good old boy network of whaling publicists, government bureaucrats and newspaper publishers has molded a successful disinformation formula that declares over and over again that they are protecting the Japanese people from foreigners who only wish to spread anti-Japanese sentiments. This successful disinformation campaign is of the same cloth as the \"patriotic\" barometer that the Bush Administration used to stifle public discussion against the invasion of Iraq after 9/11. The result is that the Japanese general public shuns Western anti-whaling groups as anti-Japanese. To ask a Japanese person to join Greenpeace is somewhat analogous to asking an American, during the 1950s to join the communist party. And it is shame.",
              "Whale protectors need to comprehend this impasse, as the crucial first step to designing a strategy to push through the censorship, and directly engage the Japanese people, themselves. Only then will the whaling industry become vulnerable. When the citizens of Japan do become engaged, I believe that Western anti-whaling protesters will be quite surprised to learn how much the Japanese people revere cetaceans.",
              "At EXPO, I was interviewed by a journalist writing a book about the community of presenters there. His intent was to express the new face of ecology within Japan. During our discussion, I expressed some of the same ideas about media censorship I have put forth in this article. He was taken aback by my directness, and asked me to clarify what I meant by censorship. I described that same worldwide protest against the dolphin drive fishery, and asked if he would cover it if I gave him a press packet. “I think you know my newspaper won’t publish something like that,” he answered with a laugh, as if it was shared joke between us.",
              "“It's a big international news event.\" I responded, \"Doesn't that count for anything?” He just smiled.",
              "This is what I learned about whale protection during my weeks at EXPO. The whales deserve a strategic overhaul by every Western activist group that works to stop whaling. Only an overhaul will severe the current link between the term, \"anti-whaling\" and the other term, \"anti-Japanese\". Perhaps then, more people within Japan will be brave enough to listen to the issue as it is."

              "Thousand Mile Song (with audio CD) by David Rothenberg (Basic Books, 2008)",
              "David Rothenberg’s last book masterfully illuminated the diverse linkage between bird calls and human music. In his new book, Thousand Mile Song, he expands upon this aesthetic to include the whales. The books strength is in establishing the historical impact humpback whale songs exert on modern human culture. As he describes so well, the discovery and popularity of these songs was the major symbol for endangered species within the burgeoning environmental movement of the 1970s. It remains so to this day.",
              "David, a jazz musician of some note, devotes several chapters to playing clarinet with various whale species. The most successful of these experiments occurred in Hawaii, making music with humpbacks. No one's ever proven why, precisely, these male whales sing, although biologists do agree that it is a song. Rothenberg's post-modern improvisatory aesthetic is well served by the realtime whale melodies and rhymes presented to his musically savvy ears.",
              "Another one of these musical events included me. I traveled with David to a bay in western Canada, where Interspecies.com brought 200 people in the 1980s to develop a communication interface with orcas. The destination was once the scene of many charged interactions between species (one of them, from 1988, is posted below). But that former wilderness has long since transmuted into a highway for noisy cruise ships, and a large whale watching fleet that never leaves the orcas during daylight hours. For those reasons, Interspecies.com abandoned the site 20 years ago. I warned, in advance, David not to expect much during our trip. Onsite, it soon became evident to me that he was satisfied simply to play his clarinet with the few whales who called among themselves from a distance. What he ended up with demonstrates the profound difference between interspecies communication, and the lesser experience of two species making sounds at the same time. This distinction is displayed in the book's audio graphs that attempt to demonstrate a musical connection which is not at all evident.",
              "Our relationships with animals are challenging, complicated, frustrating, awkward, ambiguous, paradoxical, and range all over the place. We already know a lot about their lives and what they want, more than we often give ourselves credit for. Indeed, their lives aren't all that private, hidden, or secret. We know that animals have a point of view and that they experience deep feelings. When someone says they're not sure if dogs, for example, have emotions, if they feel joy or grief, I say I'm glad I'm not their dog. When people tell me that they love animals and then harm or kill them I always tell them I'm glad they don't love me.",
              "The best way to make the world a more compassionate and peaceful place for all animal beings, to increase our compassionate footprint, is to \"mind them.\" \"Minding Animals\" means that we must \"mind\" other beings by recognizing that they have active and deep minds and feelings and that we must also \"mind\" them",
              "as their caretakers in a human dominated world in which their interests are continually trumped in deference to ours.",
              "It is also essential or people with varied expertise and interests to talk to one another, to share what we know about our animal kin and to use this knowledge for bettering their (and as a result, our) lives. There are many ways of knowing and figuring out how science and the humanities including those interested in animal protection, conservation, and environmentalism (with concerns ranging from individuals to ecosystems) can learn from one another is essential. We observe animals, gawk at them in wonder, experiment on them, eat them, wear them, write about them, draw and paint them, move them from here to there as we \"redecorate nature,\" make decisions for them without their consent, and represent them in many varied ways yet we often ignore who they are and what they want.",
              "Enough is enough. We all need to coexist peacefully and gracefully, and it's a win-win situation to make every attempt to do so in the most compassionate ways possible. For compassion for animals will make for more compassion among people and that is what we need as we journey into the future. I'm reminded of something Albert Schweitzer once wrote: \"Until he extends his circle of compassion for all living things, man will not himself find peace.\" Of course animals and plants aren't living \"things\" but let's not worry about that right now.",
              "Each of us can make a difference. We can all make positive changes for all beings by weaving compassion, empathy, respect, dignity, spirituality, peace, and love into our lives. We also need to focus on what we can do rather than what we can't do or what hasn't worked in the past. I'm an unrelenting dreamer",
              "who remains unflaggingly hopeful about what we can all do collectively if we put our hearts and heads together and agree to work harmoniously towards shared goals.",
              "We always need to mind animals and to mind earth, water, and air from deep in our hearts. We can always add more compassion to the world. Animals are asking us to treat them better or to leave them alone and we need to listen to them now, not later. Time isn't on our side. We're truly lucky to be able to work together to increase our compassionate footprint. Animals and future generations will thank us for our efforts. So let's get on with it. Never say never.",

          "content": [
              "A recent newspaper story describes the harpooning of a 2,800 pound great white shark off the coast of Connecticut. A local activist compares the incident to “going out and shooting dogs”. The proud fisherman answers this criticism by inviting the so-called \"shark lover\" to join him on the water sometime so “he can judge for himself if there is no sport involved”. A biologist attached to a local natural history museum defends the fishermen’s catch as “a once in a lifetime opportunity\", and \"a valuable addition to the museum's permanent collection.”",
              "It's a classic media debate, with sportsmen, and establishment scientists on one side, and an animal rights activist on the other. It's the stuff of new books and articles every year. Armies of authors researching mountains of statistics; collecting anecdotes, dredging up precedents, delineating incisive arguments based on statistics of museum attendance, philosophies such as anthropocentrism, the tragedy of the commons, the economics of commercial fishing. Formulas and logical arguments are distilled, condensed, and sharpened to prove that sharks, (or rain forests, or pesticides... ad infinitum) are either obviously helpful (or substitute: plentiful, or perhaps, 'hardly in dire straights')  or, just as obviously,  scarce.  Facts get assembled, lined up in rows with other facts, and are just as often rejected to elicit either some helpful measure of positive change or its opposite: the reaffirmation of business as usual.",
              "Yet no matter which side is speaking — no matter how thoughtful, rancorous, or polite the debate may turn —  the context of our public discourse about nature remains self-absorbed. It's all about us. Scientists accuse non-scientists of anthropomorphism, while activists accuse commercial interests of anthropocentrism. \"Anthropos\" is Greek for human being. Or perhaps both sides agree that the only way to make this discussion reasonable, is to reduce the human relationship to nature to numbers, data, logic. In a universe where entropy rules, reduction may be understand best as a human construct that helps objectify our own human relationship to nature. But that also suggests that feelings, or an implicit sense of right and wrong, has no place in the discussion. Even numbers can be understood as yet another language spoken by humans for humans. As strange as it may seem — these examples demonstrate the chronic lack of perception that keeps us from learning how to live at peace with nature. In an odd way, our relationship to nature seems well described as an ongoing process of going out and shooting dogs.",
              "Those who rely on a logical world subscribe to the objective viewpoint. But let us also consider that objective truth may be a mirage that seems better suited to explain the problem than the solution. Our own purveyors of objective truth are the experts. And it is these expert’s mandate to provide the rest of us with fact. Our mistake lies in believing that facts can provide a grounding for transformation. And it is transformation that is mostly missing from the solutions offered us.",
              "The experts speak to us of factual truth. Having been well taught that facts don’t lie, we listen attentively. We listen far less attentively to non-experts who offer an alternate point of view. The non-expert point of view is what we call an opinion.",
              "No decision maker bases a judgment on opinion. especially when they can base it on fact.  Opinion is the point of view of a poet, a local, a child, an animal lover. If opinion had a totem animal it would be the chameleon. Ten witnesses to a crime offer ten opinions about events. Opinion is emotional. Opinion is non-scientific. It is non-objective. Opinions are...just opinions. By contrast, facts don’t lie. Facts are facts.",
              "What the experts fail to tell us is that each distinct fact quickly loses its objective status by simple association. Link one fact to a second fact , and then a third and fourth, and watch how quickly the total transforms  into an opinion. What applies to facts also applies equally to statistics, which I define as an association of numbers and facts and opinions. In such a manner, association renders fact into something rather pliable, bent and stitched, glued and torn apart, reordered and reinterpreted in so many varied and sometimes opposing ways as to make the whole useless as an indicator of what it is always promoted to be: which is objective truth. Read any essay that links one fact to another fact, and you may owe it to yourself to learn the politics of writer to properly understand the tissue that connects each fact to the next. Some call this debunking of objective fact \"relativism\", or \"post-modernism\". These terms were thrown around a lot after 9/11 to disparage anyone being so bold as to offer criticism about those who spouted dogma to rationalize the militaristic direction our country was taking.",
              "Within our political system, exploitive interests often draw from the same effusive well of statistics as the preservationists. Both sides grab at the same fact, remolding the kindred minotaur of mindless information into a tamed beast used to forward the opposite argument of the other side. This need not seem either opportunistic or even illogical. Because our common usage of fact is so utterly dependent upon association, it is this subjective picking and choosing of these associations — and not the facts themselves — that provide the only transparent window into objective reality. But something seems awry here, since we now refer to that window as just another opinion. In such a manner, cherished ideas about reality are pulling themselves inside out. If this is the new meaning of objective reality, then let us all acknowledge that it also has the same meaning as subjective reality. We inhabit a  looking glass world. So long as fact is being laced with subjective association, the subjective is identical to the objective. It stops the moment we give up our collective fantasy that any mere human being can speak objectively.",
              "Not such a risky statement if you are a poet, or even a quantum physicist. Unfortunately, neither the commercial shark fishermen, nor the museum ichthyologist has caught up with what's happening here. If I hold any criticism hidden within this absurdist depiction of the process of experts and facts, it is only that the objective viewpoint still remains our society’s standard perception of the way things ought to be understood and judged. Meanwhile..opinions remain opinions. And we all continue to ascribe too much undeserved power to a one-sided sense of reality that, truly, is not helping us deal with the problems that beset us. These problems are legion.",
              "And so humans continue to kill huge sharks for a thrill, and then to stuff the remains into a museum display. And the science museums still believe they are fulfilling their charter to serve as an educational center, the place we gladly send  our schoolchildren to learn about sharks."

              "Which dolphin was that? Software that identifies different dolphin species by their whistles should improve the accuracy of surveys that monitor possible harm from fishing fleets. These surveys are now performed by observing animals from a boat. A fall in the number of sightings of a particular species is taken as a warning that it's time to check what the fishermen are up to. But surveys driven by binoculars pose problems, says Julie Oswald of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \"Marine mammals spend most of their time out of sight and underwater, so observer teams can miss a lot of the animals,\" she says. To make matters worse, some species are shy of boats, she adds. To pick up the hidden dolphins, and make identification easier at the same time, Oswald and her colleagues have turned to acoustics. In general, it's about time that all the people \"accidentally\" harming cetaceans — for whatever reason — started making better use of all the available acoustic, infra-red, and radar detection technologies, and donated their expensive government binoculars to the Audubon Society for teaching disadvantaged kids how to watch birds."

Later this month, for example, he will present at several venues in Europe, including the International Animal Welfare Conference in Barcelona. These presentations often focus on whale language and interspecies communication. A hybrid presentation/performance is cast in a lighter vein, to demonstrate the step-by-step process of creating ambient techno music from whale, dolphin, seal, fish, lobster, wind, and water sound samples. It's easy to convert PowerPoint to self-timed web slide shows.

The main result was a commercial CD featuring compositions by digital composers from 10 countries. Six of our composers also collaborated with filmmakers to produce music videos of their compositions. These short films have never been shown in one place, and we plan to change that over the next few months.",
              "The streaming video that opens this newsletter incorporates all three of these multimedia elements. It is basically a music video, showcasing the realtime audio of one of our best all-time human/orca musical interactions, that occurred in 1989 off the northeast coast of Vancouver Island, and recorded with hydrophones, underwater. The visual footage includes out-takes from an orca film about our work produced by a French production company, Saint Thomas Productions, and subsequently broadcast all over the world. Added in are parts of an Interspecies slide show. As this humble video collage makes amply clear, we do audio very well, but we're still learning how best to balance visual quality against size. It will get better very quickly."

              "Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, March 12, 2008 - 5:39 PM (sent in by Donna Kassewitz)",
              "A playful dolphin used to swimming round humans has amazed conservation workers by guiding two distressed whales back to sea away from likely death on a beach. 'The dolphin led the two pygmy sperm whales along the beach and through a channel to the open sea,' New Zealand Department of Conservation worker Malcolm Smith said today. The two whales, a mother and her young calf, were found stranded on Mahia Beach, on North Island's east coast on Monday morning, Smith said. 'We worked for over an hour to try to get them back out to sea ... but they kept getting disorientated and stranding again after swimming into a large sandbar just off the shore. They obviously couldn't find their way back past it to the sea.'",
              "Four attempts by volunteers to re-float the pair failed and it was becoming highly likely they would have to be euthanized, he said. Then the dolphin, named Moko by residents, swam up. 'It was looking like it was going to be a bad outcome for the whales which was very disappointing and then Moko just came along and fixed it.' Smith said it was quite possible Moko had heard the whales calling. 'The whales were ... quite distressed. They had arched their backs and were calling to one another, but as soon as the dolphin turned up they submerged into the water and followed her,' he said.",
              "'She obviously gave them guidance to leave the area because we haven't seen them since,' Smith said. 'The things that happen in nature never cease to amaze me.' Moko returned to the beach shortly afterward. The playful dolphin swam straight back close to shore and joined in water games with residents, he added."

              "Even as the Navy funds hopeful new technology to protect whales during sonar exercises, Navy lawyers and PR officers sound increasingly political in their shrill denials of responsibility to alter the deadly equation of cetaceans and sonar testing. At a recent hearing, Dr. Hal Whitehead, Professor of Cetacean Research at Dalhousie University, offered a striking metaphor about whale deaths, and why proponents are always going to see just what they need to see. Speaking to the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, Whitehead compared whales stranding after sonar exposure to tribal people chasing a herd of buffalo to the edge of a cliff. He asked the commission to consider what might be the cause of death for the stampeding buffalo. Necropsy results would show that these buffalo had died of crushed skulls and collapsed lungs due to a sudden impact. Necropsy results, he contended, would not show what caused the buffalo to run off the edge of a cliff in the first place.",
              "Dr. Whitehead compared this example of the buffalo to the cetacean population — suggesting that strandings were best understood in context with the human influence which drives the animal towards that final outcome. Did sonar kill the whales? Or did the whales die due to a sudden collision with a rocky shore resulting in bleeding eyes and collapsed lungs? In other words, what a necropsy reveals is limited and not altogether conclusive. (sent in by Bill Rossiter)"

It's difficult to comprehend the thought processes that could prompt somebody to cut off local electricity as the most appropriate response to the death of an orca that once swam among these islands. Perhaps the best understanding will be found by viewing the new, multiple-award-winning film entitled: Saving Luna."

              "It's Election Time: Only Support Sensible Leaders",
              "We and our leaders are seldom made aware of a great interspecies sensitivity crisis that produces our most challenging troubles. To improve personal social and environmental well being, we must support leaders that want to deal with this crises, and reject those that don't care about it.",
              "We need leaders who recognize that we suffer our major problems because we are socialized to disregard a significant fact, a powerful phenomenon that constantly stares us in the face.  It is exemplified by how we and all of nature relate to our natural sense/sensation of thirst.  For example, as a living being, you know that thirst lives, it exists, it's real. You've sensed and experienced its truth. From this empirical evidence, you know, first hand, that thirst is a fact, a fact of life. You can validate that.",
              "Thirst is also a fact of nature. It is as real and true as are water, clouds, wetness or a river.  They are all part of the global water cycle, a circulating natural system whose restorative and purifying processes nurture us and the world. The sensation of thirst connects our thinking and feeling to water and its balanced ways. If water did not exist, the sensation of thirst would not exist. There would be no reason for its presence.",
              "Our society is troubled because we are socialized to think that the sense/sensation of thirst, is subjective. This makes it scientifically invalid or part of \"fuzzy, touchy-feely, new-age, earth muffin thinking.\" For this reason, our thinking learns to omit the vital contribution thirst makes to produce a balance of pure water in our life, and in all of life.",
              "Normally, we neither burst from drinking excessive water nor do we dehydrate from lack of it.  This is because, as part of the water cycle, the sense of thirst is wise enough to attract us to drink and bring water into us when we need it. It is also wise enough to attract us to stop drinking because we have enough water in our system. In other words, thirst turns on and off, like a switch or faucet that has natural intelligence. The natural sense of excretion continues the balanced and nurturing ways of nature's water cycle.",
              "To our great loss, thirst and excretion seldom come into our society's explanation about how, through natural senses/sensitivities, the natural world works in cooperation and balance. We seldom learn how and why nature rarely, if ever, produces garbage or the insanity of our excessively destructive ways. We never see thirst in our scientific diagrams of the water cycle.  Thirst is not included in our list of five senses that we know and learn from.",
              "We think and live as if thirst does not exist or is unimportant. This falsehood distorts our reasoning. It is a missing fact of life that deteriorates our inborn sensibility to think and live in mutually supportive ways with our environment and each other.  It is as if we are not thirsty for whole-life knowledge because it is an inconvenient truth that confronts the insanity of our socialization bonds.",
              "We can't afford to eliminate thirst from our thinking. Thirst is one of nature's peaceful ways to produce optimums of life, unity, cooperation and diversity.",
              "Now be alarmed.  There are at least fifty additional natural system senses and sensitivities that, just like thirst, register in our psyche. And, as with thirst, we are socialized to remove them, too, from how we think and relate.  To our loss, we conquer, exploit and ignore our multitude of natural sensitivities as part of our conquest of species and nature. Wounded, these senses hurt and hide in our subconscious.  They lie there as a blocked and frustrated \"earth-speak,\" a Lorax that we inherit and that is now seldom available to help us more intelligently guide our thoughts feeling and interactions.  Without them, our troubles continue.",
              "You see, it is no accident that we say our many troubles are due to non-sense, or by senseless or insensitive thinking, or by reasoning that does not make sense. We are socialized to suffer natural-sense deprivation.  This drives the economy.  It goads us to buy tranquilizers for our sensory frustration and pain.  It urges us to buy excessive fulfillment from artificial goods and services. To our cost, we, along with the environment, suffer the detrimental side effects of our unnecessary purchases and senseless thinking.",
              "In far too many ways we continue to elect and follow leaders who lead us to pollute Earth and give it a temperature; even while we know it is stupid to do so; even while we don't want to continue deteriorating the world and ourselves.  We are in trouble because the constructive and empowering passion of our natural senses is missing from our thinking and actions.  Now is the time to make leadership candidates provide leadership in this crucial issue. Insist that they do it.  To this end, the Webstring Natural Attraction Model is available to them and us. http://www.ecopsych.com/webstrings1000.html"

              "Marine Management Is All at Sea",
              "By Stephen Hesse, for the Japan Times",
              "Our oceans and seas are in deep trouble, and if the Japanese government is to be believed, part of the blame rests with the whales. This is nonsense, of course. The degradation and resource depletion that threaten marine ecosystems worldwide are solely due to human activity.",
              "Still, Japan has struggled for decades to end an International Whaling Commission moratorium on whaling that went into force in 1986, and it is difficult not to sympathize with their frustration, if not with their cause.",
              "It's not that Japan can't kill whales. For years they have been harpooning hundreds of minke whales each year as part of a \"scientific research\" program carried out in the South Pacific and Southern Ocean, and the number killed is increasing steadily. In its own coastal waters, too, Japanese kill thousands of porpoises and dolphins annually.",
              "But Japan does not need more whales because people are clamoring for steaks and chunks of fried blubber. These days there is not even enough demand to finish off the small mountain of whale meat that is processed each year. Japan has an embarrassing surplus when it comes to whale carcasses.",
              "So why is the Japanese government still so eager to slaughter?",
              "For years the argument was cultural, that whales are a unique part of Japan's fishing and dietary traditions. That seemed reasonable to many observers, but Japanese mariners still preferred catching more profitable fish, and consumers continued to prefer anything but whale.",
              "Government spokespeople then began touting whale meat as a solution to feeding the world's starving masses. That argument, too, seemed reasonable -- but rather disingenuous. After all, Japan had spent years criticizing the cultural imperialism of anti-whaling nations that did not accept the unique role whales play in Japanese culture. Now, the same government was suggesting that non-whale eaters change their own diets.",
              "Most recently, Japanese delegates to the IWC have been preaching that whales eat far too many fish and threaten the food security of coastal nations. In short, whales are eating our fish!",
              "The solution? Kill the whales and there will be more fish for human consumption.",
              "Fortunately no amount of hubris can change the fact that such simple manipulation of the planet's ecosystems is impossible.",
              "Myriad, constantly evolving interdependencies between plants, animals and natural systems form complex ecosystems that are the foundation of human survival, providing food, fuel, pharmaceuticals and material for clothing and shelter -- the very backbone of our economic system. If marine and terrestrial ecosystems collapse, so too will the economic house of cards we have built upon them.",
              "Yes, there is trouble on the high seas, but the whales are not the problem; they are simply another species, like the tuna, swordfish, salmon and sharks that are falling victim to human ignorance and rapacious consumption.",
              "Even as we recognize that oceans are perhaps our best and last resort for food sustenance, we continue to dump our wastes into them, including industrial and agricultural chemicals, oil waste and petroleum products, heavy metals and radioactive materials.",
              "Incredibly, these are the same waters from which we pull much of the fish and shellfish we eat. Almost 20 percent of the animal protein consumed worldwide comes from seafood. Ocean fisheries are some of the most important resources for food security, and yet we are undermining their survival.",
              "Earlier this month, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Conservation Union (IUCN), an international organization headquartered in Gland, Switzerland that cooperates with 81 nations, 120 government agencies, 800 NGOs and experts in 181 countries, released a report that highlights the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde nature of our relationship with the planet's oceans.",
              "\"The conservation and sustainable use of the vulnerable ecosystems and biodiversity in deep waters and high seas are among the most critical oceans issues and environmental challenges today. Immediate impacts and threats, such as those posed by fishing, have to be reduced urgently. Activities that generate long-lasting pollution, alter climate, disrupt oceanic circulation regimes and acidify ocean waters have to be addressed, while we still can,\" warns the report.",
              "Kristina M. Gjerde, High Seas Policy Adviser to IUCN's Global Marine Program, authored the report, titled \"Ecosystems and Biodiversity in Deep Waters and High Seas.\" Readers interested in marine policy management can view it on the Web (see addresses below). But even for those interested in just knowing more about our oceans, the report contains an array of intriguing information about what goes on in the dark depths of our deep waters and high seas.",
              "Here, for example, are some morsels to chew on next time you order chu toro (fatty tuna) and the sushi chef tells you they've run out:",
              "\"In the last 42 years, capture of wild marine fish for human consumption increased from 20 million tons to 84.5 million tons,\" states the report.",
              "In addition, \"52 percent of global fish stocks are fully exploited,\" while \"overexploited and depleted species have increased from about 10 percent in the mid 1970s to 24 percent in 2002,\" according to Gjerde.",
              "Are you a fan of shark fin soup? You might find it less palatable if you knew that each year 100 million sharks and related species are caught, and many thrown back into the sea finless. Unable to swim, they are left to flounder and die.",
              "In short, we are taking more and more and leaving less and less. Over 75 percent of fish populations are fully or overexploited, and the stocks of large fish with high commercial value, such as tuna, cod and swordfish, have declined as much as 90 percent in the past 100 years.",
              "Meanwhile, the world's population has climbed to more than 6.2 billion and demand for marine resources continues to grow.",
              "To feed these billions there are now as many as 3.5 million fishing boats plying the world's oceans, and \"1 percent of those are classified as large, industrial vessels, which have the capacity to take around 60 percent of all the fish caught globally,\" states the report.",
              "How much of the global catch does Japan consume? According to a Bloomberg story by Yasumasa Song that appeared earlier this month in The Japan Times, looking at tuna alone, Japan accounts for about 630,000 tons annually -- one third of the world's total consumption.",
              "Unfortunately, waste is also rampant in the fishing industry. According to the IUCN-UNEP report, global by-catch (marine species that are caught then thrown back dead or dying because they are not commercially valued) amounts to 20 million tons a year, or approximately 25 percent of all the fish caught worldwide.",
              "Abuses, too, prevail. Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) catches worldwide total between $ 4.9 billion and $ 9.5 billion. So even if most fishers do their best to conserve fish stocks, others are catching and selling fish illegally, undermining essential conservation efforts.",
              "Gjerde notes that 90 percent of our oceans are unexplored, and only about 0.0001 percent of the deep seafloor has been subject to biological investigations. Nevertheless, human impacts can be seen shore to shore across the high seas:",
              "Over 46,000 pieces of plastic litter are floating on every sq. mile (2.56 sq. km) of ocean. In the central Pacific, there are up to 6 pounds (2.72 kg) of marine litter to every pound (0.45 kg) of plankton. Plastic waste kills up to 1 million seabirds, 100,000 sea mammals and countless fish each year, says the report. That's not to mention the millions of tons of human sewage and toxic waste that make their way into our rivers, bays and majestic oceans.",
              "So what can we do to restock, conserve and sustainably exploit the unique resources hidden beneath our seas?",
              "Gjerde calls for \"integrated oceans management based on 'ecological boundaries' rather than political ones.\" She also suggests greater protection for vulnerable species, such as deep-sea fish, and for biologically and ecologically significant ecosystems.",
              "For those wondering how difficult this might be, imagine China, Japan and Korea sitting down and agreeing to manage their shared ocean boundaries cooperatively, the same waters where patrol boats now face off. Or imagine Japan volunteering to cut its consumption of tuna by half in order to help bluefin and yellowtail stocks rebound.",
              "There is too much wealth beneath the waves for nations to cooperate willingly. It is likely to take more crashing fish stocks, more lost coral and more toxic spills before countries worldwide awaken to the critical challenges that face us and our oceans.",
              "And even if we do rise to the challenge, there is no guarantee that we will respond in time. After all, if the world's greatest marine consumer, Japan, still seeks to lay partial blame for the state of our oceans on whales, what hope is there for rational and informed policymaking anytime soon?"

A visitor clicks the image of the animals in combination with other images to create techno beats, and also receive a text message explaining the endangered status of that species. Playing constantly as a background drone is the sound of gentle waves breaking on a shore. This musical instrument is designed as an interactive prototype for museum exhibits as well as a new kind of teaching tool within the biological and geographic sciences.",

They have sold more whale meat to the suppliers so far, than they did all together last year. One of Norway’s largest low price chain-stores, RIMI, is selling different new whale meat products. So far they have been selling this products in the north of Norway, but according to the representative from Norwegian Raw Fish organization, they will expand this to other areas of the country.",
              "As a consequence of the Norwegian government’s white paper/policy on management of marine mammals, a group consisting of among others; a representative from the ministry of Fishery and coastal affairs, whale hunters and whale meat buyers, are now working on a report about “How much whale meat can be sold in Norway?” They have set a goal to market the meat from 1000 whales each year, approximately 1500 tons of whale meat.",
              "Dan's Conclusion: The report is due to 1st of November. Furthermore, I have gotten signals that the quotas are going to be set in November/December. I asked my contact in the group if he thought there is a market for this amount of whale meat, and he said yes. The Norwegian government wants an increase in the whaling quotas, and so this group will do everything to “find the market”."

              "Ben White was one of the most effective animal protectors of our time. His genius was tactical, possessing a unique ability to simplify complex issues to cast a spotlight onto public consciousness. His bottom line was to uncover the brutality that always seems to arise whenever humans (Ben referred to them as the usual gang of greedy males) feel a need to kill, eliminate, bulldoze, cut, and market the other beings that inhabit this planet with us. He is probably best known for inventing and leading the \"turtles\", at the celebrated WTO debacle in Seattle. Another campaign of his, getting jailed and then leading a very public hunger strike, showed the world the violent methods that US Oceanariums employ to capture dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico. It directly resulted in an end to the capture of dolphins in US waters.",
              "Ben White had been a member of the board of directors of Interspecies.com for the past 3 years. Perhaps because of our own focus on art for nature, I viewed him primarily as a master of polemical theater. This description always brought a smile to his face, because he once confided to me that he served as a clown for animals. If so, it was a dangerous, world-shaking kind of clowning. To me, his work was in the spirit of Abby Hoffman, Walt Whitman, Emma Goldman.",
              "Ben was my friend. Although we both traveled a lot, He and I did our best to have lunch together 2 times a month for the past 4 or 5 years. I got to experience his intellectual curiosity, his love of literature, his keen interest in tree morphology, his studies to build a home for himself and his children utilizing Japanese and indigenous forms. We both attended the International Whale Commission's meeting in Japan three summers ago. Afterward I led him to a remote hot springs village deep in the mountains. For two days we got to walk the streets wearing our bathrobes and carrying our towels back and forth from our little bamboo Inn to the famous healing waters, where we shared the bath mostly with old people we soon learned were survivors of the Hiroshima bomb. The memory of Ben smiling broadly, dressed in his woolen Hapi jacket over a Ukata bathrobe, and pointing at the ceramic penises for sale in every store, is the vision I carry of Ben White.",
              "Ben died last Saturday of cancer. For the past two weeks I'd visited his bedside four times to play an Indian raga, and watch him slowly recede before my eyes. The last time, Friday night, he was breathing at such a slow rate, I couldn't imagine his body getting any oxygen. It was difficult to play that evening. Trying to figure out how to introduce exotic sound into that silent room took all of my musical experience and strength. Yet despite the fact that everyone present knew that death was already living in the room, Ben managed a weak smile midway through the performance. I like to think of it as a sign from Ben the intrepid geographer, Ben the canny ambassador, offering a hint that the other side is as interesting as the life he was already exiting."

          "content": [
              "Interspecies.com recently received a letter asking us to help put together a roster of speakers for an international conference focused on both interspecies and intraspecies communication. My first thought was that the two concepts were totally different from one another, and would draw its speakers from completely different communities. Intraspecies communication is mostly a branch of scientific research that merges cognitive science, animal behavior, bio-acoustics, linguistics, and semiotics. Within the field of cetacean intraspecies research, I can name about 12 people in the world who are actively engaged in the subject. The idea of getting us all together in one place would be a first, and I believe it would produce profound results. Interspecies Communication involves scientists, but also artists, mystics, environmentalists, how-to authors, vets and pets — animal lovers of every persuasion. I responded to the query by declaring that, right now, an intra conference interested me immensely, but it would never be a successful commercial venture. With disciplined promotion, the inter conference could potentially fill the Superdome.",
              "The promoter's reply stated that the conference would focus on interspecies communication, but could conceivably include a small symposium focused on the 12 or so researchers studying cetacean language. I responded again, this time to offer two modest caveats. First, I had no personal interest in participating in a conference heavy on presenters focused on spiritual connections to domestic animals. And second, no extraterrestrial contact. The answer I received back suggested that the interspecies agenda was too near-sighted to elaborate the real promise of interspecies communication.",
              "One thing Interspecies does well, is to offer a counterpoint to the so-called nature establishment, who make all sorts of restrictions that ostensibly \"protect\" wild animals, but which offer no breathing room for the potential promise of humans perceiving themselves as part of the greater community of nature. Interspecies promotes the rather obvious idea that if socially sophisticated animals like dolphins come to us, we ought to be able to greet them. Our working method is entirely experiential, and for 30 years, Interspecies has plumbed the depths of this greeting. Our cultural message involves providing various forms of media that depict and elaborate upon this two way process of greeting. Music has always been the best medium.",
              "Because we are so focused on transforming the hardline mainstream view that keeps human culture much too separated from nature, we choose not to focus on what is a genuine spiritual aspect of this greeting. We do not emphasize this aspect any more or less than the scientific or environmental aspects. We prefer the challenge of thinking like an animal, and thus presenting the three views as a unified view, call it the human view. Ironically, that implies that interspecies is actually demonstrating that  all-is-one, much more than it is for the people who use that mantra only to emphasize the spiritual, or their opposite number, the people who fail to see any other version of nature beyond objective science. This trickster mentality is an explicit theme of my book, The Charged Border, which details various experts representing various paradigms (often in intellectual conflict with each other) all relate to cetaceans with equal enthusiasm but seeking very different results. Each view has its own chapter. A few of the reviews called the book controversial, because I gave equal respect to the people holding hands in knee deep water while chanting dolphin slogans, as I do to the scientists who prefer binoculars thrust tightly against their eyes.",
              "I have attended conferences where speakers insist upon their own unique understanding of cetaceans, but who have no firsthand experience of dolphins in the wild. I have listened to speakers who attribute wildly speculative behavior to dolphins, which if even plausible, would not mark the behavior of any species, but of 6 or 8 different species that inhabit entirely different ecosystems. This listening experience runs parallel with the experience of listening to trainers or lab scientists who attribute wonderful qualities to their captive animals, but who do horrible things to them. Too often, the same people who promote unverifiable talents to cetaceans, also claim that they are the unique arbiter of these unobservable facts, and that every other interpretation is less exalted. I am able to speculate with the best of them. But I do not appreciate listening to people who treat their speculation as fact, and fact as, therefore, speculation.",
              "To me the spiritual isn’t about holding hands knee deep in water. Rather, that is a technique —sometimes viable, sometimes not — for approaching the spiritual. Religious ceremony is another technique. Swimming with dolphins. etc. You get the idea. Listening to a whale respond while playing music is another. By contrast, the spiritual is the actual linkage to the sacred that each one of us feels while immersed in the technique. If this differentiation between technique and linkage makes any sense, then hopefully you will also understand why I choose to declare, emphatically, that my own personal sense of linkage is not what I wish to represent to my mainstream audience about whales. I find true linkage (also called: a sense of the sacred) to be utterly nontransferable, because it is only personal. When the personal is made public, it usually sets up a polarity between the blessed and unblessed. It's the same historical spark that causes holy war. The primary work of interspecies is about protecting whales. We promote whale survival as a matter of planetary health. Towards that objective, Interspecies.com produces media that, hopefully, depicts the kind of greeting that demonstrates whale intelligence, creativity, wisdom, right to life. So our musical and media tools are all about technique, and the cultural transformation that the successful presentation of these techniques recommends.",

              "(excerpted from the New York Times)",
              "The song of the blue whale, the deepest-toned animal call on the planet, has mysteriously grown even deeper. The calls have been steadily dropping in frequency for seven populations of blue whales around the world over the past 40 years, say researchers at several institutions. The scientists analyzed recorded data and found that the songs, which they believe are by males advertising for mates, had lowered by as much as 30 percent in certain populations. Most of these songs encompass frequencies too low to be detected by the human ear. John Hildebrand, professor of oceanography at Scripps and an author of the study, said the drop might signal a rebound in the population of blue whales since commercial whaling bans began to take effect in the 1970s.",
              "Scientists believe that only male blue whales sing. Female blue whales choose their mates based on size, a selection process that has fostered the species’ gargantuan proportions. And deeper might signal bigger. When populations were smaller, whales may have had to be louder to make their calls heard. Now, the males might be competing to make their calls deeper, said Sarah Mesnick, a behavioral ecologist at the NOAA Fisheries Service and one of the study’s authors. “The idea is, as density increases and there are more individuals competing to find mates, that we expect the mating display to change,” Dr. Mesnick said. “We may be seeing that in two ways with blue whales: the songs are getting lower and a little less loud.”",
              "Lower-frequency sounds may also travel farther. “But in the blue whale vocal range, which is 10 hertz to 100 hertz,” said Mark A. McDonald, the study’s lead researcher who specializes in underwater acoustics, “there is no practical difference in the sound transmission properties in the deep ocean.”",
              "Blue whale populations could be growing by 5 percent each year, said Trevor Branch, a fisheries scientist at the University of Washington. But the numbers are hard to come by and vary in quality depending on the population, because blue whales, unlike humpbacks, are elusive and rarely approach shore. Dr. Branch, who was not associated with the song study, estimates that there are up to 25,000 blue whales, compared with perhaps 300,000 before whaling. The number may have risen from a low of about 10,000 animals.",
              "The population-rebound explanation, while speculative, is compelling to David Mellinger, from Oregon State University who has studied blue whales for the past 16 years. Dr. Mellinger, who is not part of the study, said, “It’s hard to see anything that would have impacted all of those populations and made them all decrease frequency other than the increase in the population.”",

As The New York Times (kind of) points out, a far greater threat to cetaceans than Navy sonar, is ship strikes. It is an especially dire issue wherever slow, and endangered right whales migrate through shipping lanes near big cities along the US East Coast. Since the solution we are designing will, essentially, detect whales far more accurately, and at greater distances, than ever before, the same system can also be deployed in shipping lanes to alert skippers whenever a large, moving body passes in front of their bow. This is good stuff for the real world.",

              "I have just returned from Japan EXPO, where Interspecies served during the month of August as an invited co-host with ICERC-Japan, at a pavilion inside the so-called NGO village. My purpose was to perform 3 shows about interspecies long term work of using music and art to communicate with various cetaceans around the world. ICERC is Japan’s foremost whale and dolphin NGO. During the final Sunday of my participation at EXPO, the NGO village hosted almost 100,000 people.",
              "The  centerpiece of our pavilion, was a computer kiosk called the WhaleSinger, a musical instrument I designed in collaboration with German software company, Native Instruments. The Whalesinger is an innovative tool to teach children about cetaceans and underwater sound. A child presses an array of large buttons to view a picture and hear the call of 15 different cetacean species. A window then pops up to provide basic info, in both Japanese and English, about that species habitat, behavior, and endangered status. Press other buttons to hear these whale calls looped and layered to create simple melodies and rhythms. Turn a dial to add a gentle drone of waves breaking on the shore, or a slowly undulating musical tone. If you like what you hear, you can press the buttons in sequences of your own invention to compose original techno music of a startlingly high quality.",
              "Over the week of my stay, I was interviewed by 3 newspapers. The Whalesinger was bulleted by the news as an essential sight not to miss at EXPO.  My final presentation of that weekend was documented in full, for viewing on Nagoya television. All this coverage was especially gratifying, given the fact that EXPO included almost 100 country and city pavilions and over 500 company, institutional, and organizational exhibits spread across a huge campus. Attendance at my presentation made it abundantly clear that the Japanese people are extremely interested in the intelligence, communication abilities, and grace of living cetaceans.",
              "EXPO was for kids. Its general theme focused on innovation, technology, and environmental education to help guide children to build a new world where humanity works together to protect nature. The planners succeeded to present the Japanese, themselves,  as leaders, designers, architects, of this ecological good news future. Examples of their leadership role could be found everywhere you looked. The flanks of the hill upon which EXPO was built, were covered by the largest array of solar panels I have ever seen.  The toilets were simply remarkable, with solar-powered filtering systems that recycled a small amount of water to service the huge crowds for months on end.",
              "This EXPO theme left me acutely aware of my own role of presenting a compassionate vision of living, intelligent whales and dolphins to a large mainstream audience of Japanese citizens. We Westerners so often think of the Japanese as ecological brutes. This view is, perhaps, most egregiously displayed by the ongoing thuggish policies of the Japanese whaling industry, as well as by the national disgrace of the Taiji dolphin drive fishery. The disconnect between EXPO’s vision and this international characterization is simply too glaring to overlook. I believe most eco-professionals would agree that, despite the solar panels and other eco-technology,  Japan will never emerge from its role as destroyer of nature until it stops killing whales and dolphins.",
              "Every Westerner I know who works to protect cetaceans, eventually becomes painfully aware of the extent that the Japanese  government and media censor information from abroad that reports Japan’s nefarious role as the world’s primary whaling nation. The result is a vacuum. There is absolutely no discussion within Japan about either the dubious ethics of whaling, or its heated protest within the international community. In other words, both the Japanese government and the mainstream Japanese media are 100% complicit in sanctioning and supporting the whaling and dolphin killing.",
              "How bad is the censorship? Next month, October, a large collective of  Western ecology groups are planning huge demonstrations at Japanese embassies around the world (see the story below). This protest is focused on publicizing the dolphin drive fisheries. Fishermen in several towns around Japan capture and kill dolphins by the thousands, mostly as a reckless measure to correct the egregious destruction of fish stocks by human over-fishing. At EXPO, I had the pleasure to work with several Japanese ecologists, many of whom focus on cetacean issues. Not one of them knew about this upcoming protest. Worse, the two people I spoke to at length about the protest, became embarrassed when I asked if they would publicly support it.",
              "The embarrassment is chronic.  Within Japan, to take sides against the Japanese whale-killing juggernaut, is somewhat analogous to an American animal rights activist lobbyist against beef consumption in a ranching state. There is however, one main difference. The whaling industry is a very small group of men whose wild and threatened “product” provides food for an exceedingly small percentage of Japanese people. And their industry is condemned as profoundly anti-ecological by almost every government and whale scientist in the world. My friend’s embarrassment seemed yet another victory for the whaling industry.",
              "This censorship reminds me of the way the Bush administration has so skillfully marginalized liberals in the USA, until the term itself seems a synonym for foolishness. In such a manner, the Japanese whaling industry marginalizes any and all forms of protest against the killing of cetaceans both large and small. Since the very beginning of the anti-whaling movement in the West in the mid-1970’s, this covert censorship has kept almost every instance of Western protest against whaling out of the Japanese media.",
              "For some years now, I have been aware that my own work with whales is “acceptable” by Japanese media standards. Two reasons explain why I get interviewed so often. First, the Japanese people do love to learn about whales as much as anyone else. Second,  the basis of my work is in art and music rather than political activism. I make it past the covert censors because my message is for whale intelligence with an unmistakable focus on meeting the living animals themselves, and not against  the whale-killing industry. The notable result is that after 15 trips to Japan since 1978 working on cetacean issues, and with well over 100 interviews in Japanese newspapers, radio, and TV, I may be the only Western cetacean professional most Japanese people have ever heard of. And yet I get almost no support from Western whale groups, who reject my proposals for working within Japan as lacking the bite to ever affect whaling.",
              "Let’s take a closer look at this bite. Any attempt to stop whaling within Japan, can never succeed until whale protection groups figure out how to break through the complicit network of whalers, government, and media, that keeps this issue away from the Japanese people. Or permit me to state the case even more strongly. The best known Western anti-whaling groups are overwhelmingly directed by two different groups of professionals.  One group, the lawyers, are tactically effective by lobbying to contain whaling on the governmental level in the halls of the International Whaling Commission. Their work is important. It is mostly out of the public’s gaze. Unfortunately, it has almost no strategic value.",
              "The other group, essentially publicists and organizers, direct protests as social statements that produce news to affect public opinion. Do you dutifully send in your money in support of groups whose protests make big news in London, or Los Angeles or Sydney? If so, you might ask yourself: what purpose does any anti-whaling protest serve other than as a fundraising event for anti-whaling groups? After so many years of working in Japan, I feel sad to conclude that your money is being wasted. No one in Japan ever hears about these protests. And until the Japanese do hear about them, and are prompted to discuss them and get involved themselves, nothing is ever going to change.",
              "Protest is a powerful political and social tool. It engages people in the street, creates community, granting like-minded groups a legitimate outlet to express their discontent. A successful protest spreads the story of this discontent, achieving the important goal of eliciting more discussion, and asserting pressure on the people who actually have the ability to alter bad policy. But when the story, the community, and the pressure is always Western, and never reaches the people who are able to do something about it, protest never achieves its potential.  Discouragement and possibly outrage are two results. Years of aborted protest against Japanese whaling have left the protesters, themselves, feeling a negative opinion of the Japanese people.",
              "In Tokyo, behind the scenes, the good old boy network of whaling publicists, government bureaucrats and newspaper publishers censors the protests, arrogantly insisting that they are protecting the Japanese people from foreigners who only wish to spread anti-Japanese sentiments. It is simply true that, within Japan, anti-whaling protest has become a synonym for an anti-Japanese smear campaign. Rather than join the international discussion, citizens reject anything originating from anti-whaling groups as anti-Japanese. Any Japanese who takes sides against the whaling industry, even by encouraging an open discussion of the issue, is considered foolish,, someone to be marginalized.",
              "Only when this embedded system begins to change—only when the discussion transforms to engage the Japanese people themselves—will the whaling industry ever become vulnerable. When the citizens of Japan do become engaged, I believe the Western anti-whaling protesters  will be very surprised at how much the Japanese people revere cetaceans.",
              "After one of my whale shows, I was interviewed by a savvy journalist, for a book about some of the interesting presenters at EXPO. The man’s writing was focused on the community of EXPO, as a means to change the face of ecology within Japan. During the interview, I expressed some of the same ideas about media censorship I have put forth in this article. My interviewer had never heard this idea expressed before, and asked me to clarify what I meant by censorship. I described the worldwide protest against the dolphin drive fishery coming up next month. Then I asked if he would cover it if someone sent him a press packet. “I think you must know that my newspaper won’t publish something like that,” he answered with a laugh, as if it was shared joke between us.

I feel the whales deserve an honest  strategy appraisal by Western activist groups who receive public funds to stop whaling.

I feel my own putative celebrity within Japan gives me a certain qualification to guide others who are now getting paid to help save the whales.

              "Hopefully you noticed that there was no August issue of this monthly newsletter. I was in Bolivia for August; trekking in the Amazon head waters recording animal calls in the Amboro cloud forest. The most musical animal was, without a doubt, a rather common local bird called the oropendola. These are oriole relatives, mostly black, with vibrant yellow tail feathers, and with the same hanging nests. Both the Amazon and the crested oropendola produce bell-like tones, with individual calls often punctuated by an otherworldly crackling rhythm. Each oropendola call is brilliantly improvized, so I recorded many original bird melodies at several different locations in Bolivia, eventually building a significant library of unique songs. These calls will eventually become one aspect of a multimedia presentation about the Amazon.",
              "The internet is a great resource for listening to the immense diversity of bird calls from around the world. The best overview of what is available is found at a site administered by Stony Brook University in New York. The most exhaustive collection of South American bird calls is at Xeno-Canto which makes available over 6000 recordings from 2242 different bird species. Try their search engine; it had me lingering to listen to birds i never heard of, for over an hour one recent evening. My search for oropendola calls turned up 42 unique recordings from 8 species.",
              "The elaborate songs of songbirds offer an obvious model for investigating the evolution and cognitive structures of animal communication. If you wish to delve deeper into the subject, read this scientific paper that describes an attempt to reconstruct historical changes in song evolution. The researchers based their study on several years of recordings of oropendola songs."

              "LONDON -- Politicians and officials are sometimes their countries' worst enemies. Some politicians and officials behave ineptly and tactlessly in ways that damage the national interests of their country. We all need to remember the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. The third paragraph of the declaration, adopted July 4, 1776, affirmed that \"all men are created equal . . . (and have) certain unalienable Rights, (that) among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" The U.S. Constitution reaffirmed these principles and asserted the principle of justice for all.",
              "Unfortunately, some actions of the present U.S. administration -- such as holding combatants captured in Iraq and Afghanistan without trial, and in legal limbo, at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- suggest that there are American politicians and officials who have forgotten these basic principles and who do not care how much damage the maintenance of this prison does to America's prestige and standing in the world.",
              "Japanese politicians and officials are often just as insensitive to their country's national interests. I will refrain from pursuing the question of whether the prime minister and other government officials should visit Yasukuni Shrine, relevant though this is, because it has been reiterated so many times recently. Instead, let me take up what may seem to be a matter of lesser importance, but one that has the capacity to damage Japan's national interests more widely than those directly involved seem to realize: commercial whaling.",
              "World opinion has viewed Japanese behavior on this vexing question as generally insensitive and counterproductive. The behavior could damage Japan's prestige and reputation. I do not want to argue about the rights and wrongs of commercial whaling. I accept that a case for limited resumption of commercial whaling can be argued, although I would need more persuasive arguments than Japanese delegates have so far been able to produce.",
              "The issue needs to be considered against all the best scientific data and in the light of world opinion, insofar as this can be objectively measured, and of the fact that even in Japan the demand for whale meat has been declining and seems likely to continue to decline. An objective discussion seems unattainable while the Japanese government continues to heavily subsidize the Japanese whale fleet.",
              "Why does the Fisheries Agency continue a policy for which there does not seem to be any commercial justification? Is it for historical reasons, or does it stem from lobby groups in the Diet and funds being hived off to politicians? Whatever the reason, and whatever the arguments for the resumption of commercial whaling, Japanese tactics in the International Whaling Commission have, at best, come across as insensitive and have certainly increased opposition in Western countries to a resumption of commercial whaling.",
              "Intemperate statements by Japanese delegates, which sound contemptuous of their opponents who stand accused of waxing sentimental over the world's largest mammal, are unhelpful. Reports that Japanese delegates at commission meetings have tried to \"buy\" the votes of countries have certainly damaged Japan's reputation. Some states with no history of commercial whaling apparently have been induced with offers of development aid to join the commission on Japan's side. Some are mini-states with tiny populations such as Kiribati, a former tiny British colony in the Pacific; the Marshall Islands, also in the Pacific; and St. Kitts, an island state in the West Indies, where the IWC met in June.",
              "Japanese delegates are said to have offered \"help\" to such countries in exchange for a vote in support of commercial whaling. Development aid should never be linked to politics in this way. I hope that Japanese aid agencies will decline to accept such requests from the Fisheries Agency, which has taken on the role of representing Japan before the IWC. I also hope that Japanese diplomats will do what they can to regain control of Japanese representation at IWC meetings; do much more to prevent the Fisheries Agency, through its crass and tactless behavior, from undermining any case Japan may have for the resumption of commercial whaling; and recognize that the agency is only succeeding in damaging Japan's reputation and image.",
              "The only recent anti-Japanese demonstration that I have seen in London was over whaling. It does no good for Japan to condemn such demonstrations as unrepresentative and based on sentimentality. The demonstrations are supported by the green lobby, which is growing everywhere and must be taken seriously even if its proposals sometimes seem to go \"over the top.\"",
              "The issue of whaling is not a new one. It does reflect outdated protectionist traditions of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Throughout trade negotiations designed to promote foreign trade and Japan's overall national interest, the ministry has often seemed intent on sabotaging Japanese efforts to find solutions by sticking obstinately to a narrow-minded view aimed at protecting the interests of the ministry's clients. The ministry has made concessions only when they have appeared unavoidable to prevent a breakdown, or when great political pressure has been applied.",
              "My experience over the years with Japanese bureaucrats has been that they are clever and hardworking but that many of them suffer from myopia and an inability to see the bigger picture of Japanese national interests as a whole. Such people may be sincere, but they are the enemies of Japan's national interests."

And while rehearsing these songs in their sleep, they duplicate subtle versions of the movements they made while inventing the songs. As the researcher concludes, \"the songbird dreams of singing.\"",

The researcher's own comments about his discovery also offer a glimpse of the intellectual openness practiced for more than a century by bird scientists. \"Plain-tailed wren choruses may be the most highly coordinated and complex group vocalizations sung by any animal. As to whether they are more complex than human group vocalizations, I expect that the degree of coordination within plain-tailed wren choruses would be the envy of any choral conductor or orchestra leader.\" Click on the name above to hear the birds for yourself.",
              "This online newsletter will continue to report the best of bird research, for two reasons that strike at the heart of our work with artists and nature. Of all animal research, recent bird studies not only provide a profound understanding into bird culture, but they are also re-making the human definition of what, precisely, is an animal. This research elucidates a clear linkage between bird songs and human music. Since human music is grounded in the philosophy of aesthetics, is it possible to study bird song and not conclude that birds must also have a sense of aesthetics?",
              "It seems noteworthy that bird researchers are making these discoveries that extend our human perception of animal consciousness and culture, and not primate researchers or whale researchers. Cetacean researchers, in particular, seem illogically close-minded about acknowledging language and intellectual culture as fit subjects for study. The reason is embedded in the culture of the research itself. If the research community started representing the orca, for instance, as a sentient being possessed of a sense of right and wrong, one can easily imagine that the researchers themselves would be forced to redefine the ethics of their own study methods, which are sometimes deplorable. Imagine how it would alter the current discussion about whaling.",
              "Along the east coast of Vancouver Island, mainstream researchers and whale watching skippers go out of their way to ban any person transmitting quiet music or voice into the water in an attempt to communicate with — essentially to meet halfway — the local orcas. Yet many of these same scientists zoom around the water in noisy motorboats which make far more noise for far longer periods of time. The whalewatching community is worse. They make the most noise of all, and for months on end. The overt censorship against musicians and seekers (scientists and non-scientists alike) derives from intention. Making a lot of noise to gather a data set about fin coloration or to make money from tourism is actively encouraged, and often subsidized by tax dollars. But making music to elaborate a new interactive relationship with orcas, is forbidden within the current paradigm. Those who choose to interact are chastened as hacks or mystics. While most of the censors would deny that encouraging interaction is dangerous to their very subjective worldview, the closed-mindedness clearly succeeds in keeping a dated worldview intact.",
              "Let's take it a step further. We at Interspecies have long believed that there are many species of animals possessing a well-developed consciousness, communication capability, and, yes, sense of aesthetics. Aesthetics suggests a sense of beauty. Beauty is defined as making choices and showing preferences about media — which includes movement, sounds, and interactions.",
              "We at Interspecies are ethological futurists. If, indeed, the birds demonstrate a clear sense of aesthetics, then you can bet the bank that other species demonstrate it as well, although the media they use to express it is less explicit to the agenda-laden community that governs the research. Times are changing. In the next five years, expect to hear more about whales, dolphins, wolves possessing language, deep culture, and a sense of aesthetics. And thank the bird scientists for leading the way.",

If birds, whales, chimps, and wolves (why stop there...how about octopus, slime mold, so on) demonstrate a sense of aesthetics, then perhaps they utilize other aspects of human civilization as well: ethics, epistemology, law, a sense of the sacred. Start looking for these claims to show up in the bird literature within the next five years. Primate and Cetacean journals won't show anything for at least 10 more years.",
              "Or read about it right now, in hundreds of books of Native beliefs. For instance, there is a belief among native people in Alaska that the animal we observe in nature is dressed in a disguise he or she puts on to visit our world. Once home again, the  animal removes its fur, its scales, its feathers, and shows its true form which is identical to a human’s true form. One last prediction. Only when the scientific community accepts interspecies communication as a valid research technique, will any animal ever invite a scientist into its home."

              "Leafy Sea Dragon is a computer software system designed to facilitate communication with whales and dolphins. It is the work of Serge Maase, a Java programmer living in Montreal.",
              "Think of Serge's Java program as instant messaging software for dolphins and humans. It does not translate whistles, but rather, attempts to recognize them, thus allowing the human user to assign names to individual whistles. It also automatically assigns identifiers to unrecognized whistles, through a process of noting similarities and differences with other sounds. Through such a process, the software greatly enhances a researcher's ability to identify and categorize the structure of cetacean communication. It is up to the user to figure out their meaning.",
              "Leafy Sea Dragon not only analyses, but can also be configured to emit whistles underwater. Once it whistles, it follows up by assigning text names to any whistles emitted by cetaceans in response to these self-generated whistles.",
              "Serge regards the current version of Leafy Sea Dragon to be a Beta, or early phase in the software's development. Nonetheless, it is robust enough to be used right now by adventurous communication scientists and whale watchers with a technical bent. Technical support is provided by Serge himself.",
              "How might Leafy be developed? Just for one example, it has been suggested as a communication tool for treating medical issues of captive dolphins, facilitating an artificial vocabulary of whistles that describe ailments, symptoms, body parts, etc."

              "Fewer whale experts than you might expect, are willing to acknowledge that the whales possess a genuine interest in human beings as cultural animals. Few acknowledge that whales will occasionally attempt to interact with us in a coherent, logical manner.",
              "Communication between species is subjective, anecdotal, often personal, and usually subtle. Consequently, people who do not believe that such an interaction is possible, are the most likely to miss it as it is unfolding. They prefer to reach into the bag of acceptable behavior, to explain it as something far more mundane. In other words, it can be argued that a person must be open to the very possibility of interaction, to perceive a whale's attempt at interspecies communication as it unfolds.",
              "For years now I have been speaking at whale conferences, where I play audio interactions I have recorded underwater with orcas, dolphins, or belugas. I usually precede these demonstrations by stating, \"If interaction between species is really happening, you will simply hear it for yourself, and therefore I do not need to make any claims.\" The vast majority of my audiences do hear it for themselves, and this includes some of the world's best known dolphin and beluga scientists. Overwhelmingly, the only people who never hear it are the orca scientists. I don't know why this group remains so uniquely unmoved. Orca scientists are the most likely to contend that I am merely playing along with the calls the orcas are making simultaneously (but not synchronously) as I play. I try to point out that these recordings often demonstrate the whales changing their own tune to copy my melodies, or changing pitch to match my pitch, or that the whales and I often remain silent while the other is calling, and vice versa. Nothing I play seems capable to sway this professional judgment. Science is deep with answers, and it can easily provide alternative explanations for ostensibly misguided people like myself who experience whale behavior and sense contact. The fact that orca vocalizations have probably been analyzed in so much more detail than the other two species, may play some role in this negative professional judgment.",
              "One can make the case that orca scientists — the scouts whose job it is to inform human culture about the truth of orca existence — are actually trained to disbelieve in correspondence between species. The experience of correspondence is subjective. It lacks the mandatory objectivity. Our experts are, therefore, always going to be the last people to acknowledge that the whales may be reaching out to us seeking correspondence, juice, relationship, community.",
              "Many non-experts who possess deep experience observing orcas and their behavior, posit that the whales possess perceptions and communication abilities beyond the stereotypical calls, movements, and other replicable, data-driven behaviors that constitute the totality of scientific acceptance. These talents and perceptions include a pro-active seeking of interspecies interaction, a well-developed whale sense of aesthetics, musical communication, and even telepathy.",
              "Ironically, while all these subjects are often discussed with a sense of awe at scientific conferences, such discussions always occur off the podium, and never onstage or in the journals. That pervasive silence about alternative whale talents is one reason why interspecies.com exists — to grant a plausible forum for all the serendipitous and professionally discredited experiences that have always defined human/whale relations. We at Interspecies have long believed that our culture errs when it grants whale scientists the power to define these beings for the rest of us.",
              "I have just returned home from a week spent on a boat off the north coast of Vancouver Island, occasionally playing the electric mandolin (photo at the top) through an underwater system whenever the local orcas were in the vicinity. I have been conducting this communication research with the same pods of orcas almost every summer since 1976. When I started, the place was usually void of boat noise for hours at a time, and the wilderness setting offered a uniquely focused opportunity to interact with these orcas. Clearly, the best recorded interactions occurred before 1990. Some critical mass was achieved that year. The wilderness was dwindling, nearby towns had blossomed, boat traffic was increasing, and tourism expanded every year. Today, in summer, three or four whale-watching boats follow those local orca pods for 12 or more hours every day, and it has become virtually impossible to record an acoustic interaction with the whales without ambient boat noise sounding louder than either the whales or my own musical offerings.",
              "The whales are awesome acoustic sensors. They seem to have responded to the growing lack of acoustic privacy by vocalizing less often among themselves, and far less often still, to express their well-developed acoustic aesthetic among humans. Ironically, because I have always been the only researcher in the neighborhood who was actively seeking correspondence with these animals, I seem to be the only researcher to have concluded that these northern resident orcas are no longer as animated with their calls, nor as likely to interact with a human being. Every year that I return, I go through a period of sadness to recognize that whatever correspondence I once enjoyed has ended, perhaps forever. And still, no other whale expert in the area seems willing to consider the possibility that a potent opportunity can exist, ever did exist, let alone that it has ended.",
              "This year I was joined on the boat by distinguished author and musician David Rothenberg, who is writing a book to shed fresh insight into the fabled whale-to-human-to-whale perception, music, language, aesthetics, etc. His last book was called Why Birds Sing. You can read for yourself what David has written on the general subject of interspecies music.",
              "As I say, communication with cetaceans is subjective, anecdotal, often personal, and always subtle. Although our recent voyage sometimes left me feeling a sense of deja vu about long gone events, the whales still showed us one spectacular behavior beyond the norm. Dolphin researcher, John Lilly, once confided to me that whales and dolphins are \"masters of coincidence control.\" He offered that odd description to explain the common (and mysterious) experience of cetaceans so often showing themselves precisely when we need them to. In other words, what we humans often experience as a serendipitous meeting, Lilly believed was a planned event. \"Coincidence control\" also verifies that Lilly also believed that cetaceans are telepathic. Our skipper for this recent trip, Jim O'Donnell, is a firm advocate of Coincidence Control. He has reached this conclusion while cruising these waters, quietly filming the local orcas, for over 30 years.",
              "David and I played music into the water for a day and a night and yet never succeeded to engage the local orcas. Jim O'Donnell then heard a forecast for bad weather on the radio, and decided to follow his intuition to go find them sooner than later. He found them soon enough. It was the same pod with which I had experienced my best interactions and recordings 20 years earlier. They were frolicking right in our path in a tiny inlet, and almost seemed to wait until we were next to them. Then the eight whales started traveling up the strait at the same slow pace of our sailboat. Ten minutes later, at a point between our own boat and the OrcaLab research center, all the whales started jumping out of the water, in an uncommon behavior called breaching. All of them were breaching, perhaps 30 times in ten minutes. In 30 years of watching them, neither Jim nor I had ever witnessed such a visual display of orca bodies. Still traveling slowly, within another mile they cut directly under our boat, and sped away at top speed, soon losing us. Both Jim and I smiled to speculate that we had just been gifted with a splendid example of coincidence control. It was David's first encounter with wild orcas, and he was less inclined to describe the event in such odd terms. All the pictures above were taken by David."

I’m also curious if he’s ever tried playing this music with wild cetaceans. That would be a worthy experiment, since the orcas or dolphins would emphatically attempt to alter the flow of his music.

              "By Franz de Waal",
              "No one blinks when a celebrity is called “vacuous” or a politician a “moron”. But when headlines screamed recently that dolphins are “dimwits”, I was truly shocked. Is this a way to talk about an animal so revered that there are several Web domain names that include “smart dolphin”? This is not to say that one should believe everything about them. For example, their supposed “smile” is fake (they lack the facial musculature for expressions), and all we seem to have learned from chatting “dolphinese” with them is that lone male dolphins are keenly interested in female researchers.",
              "That dolphins are dimwits is the claim of Paul Manger, a South African scientist who says that dolphins’ relatively large brains are due simply to preponderance of fatty glial cells. These glia produce heat, which allows the brain’s neurons to do their job in the cold ocean. Based on this observation, Professor Manger couldn’t resist speculating that the intelligence of dolphins and other cetaceans (like whales and porpoises) is vastly overrated. He offered gems of insight, such as that dolphins are too stupid to jump over a slight barrier (as when they are trapped in a tuna net), whereas most other animals will. Even a goldfish will jump out of its bowl, he noted.",
              "If we skip the technicalities — such as that glial cells are not simply insulation, that they add connectivity to the brain, and that humans, too, have many more glial cells than neurons — the question remains why the prospect of animal intelligence sets off such controversy. Could it be that the huge size of the dolphin brain, which exceeds ours by 15 percent or more, threatens the human ego? Are we to ignore the billions and billions of neurons that dolphins do possess?",
              "The goldfish remark reminded me of a common strategy of those who play down animal intelligence. They love to “demonstrate” remarkable cognitive feats in small-brained species: if a rat or pigeon can do it, it can’t be that special. Thus, some pigeons have been trained to use “symbolic communication” by pecking a key marked “thank you!” that delivered food to another pigeon. And they have also been conditioned to peck at their own bodies in front of a mirror, supporting the claim that they are “self-aware.”",
              "Clearly, pigeons are trainable. But is this truly comparable to the actions of Presley, a dolphin at the New York Aquarium, who, without any rewards, reacted to being marked with paint by taking off at high speed to a distant part of his tank where a mirror was mounted? There he spun round and round, the way we do in a dressing room, appearing to check himself out.",
              "What is so upsetting to some people about the closeness between animal and human intelligence, or between animal and human emotions, for that matter? Just saying that animals can learn from each other, and hence have rudimentary cultures, or that they can be jealous or empathic is taken by some as a personal affront. Accusations of anthropomorphism will fly, and we’ll be urged to be parsimonious in our explanations. The message is that animals are no humans.",
              "That much is obvious. But it is equally true that humans are animals. Is it so outlandish, from an evolutionary standpoint, to assume that if a large-brained mammal acts similarly to us under similar circumstances, the psychology behind its behavior is probably similar, too? This is true parsimony in the scientific sense, the idea that the simplest explanation is often the best. Those who resist this framework are in “anthropodenial” — they cling to unproven differences.",
              "Since Aristotle, humans have known that dolphins are incredibly social. Each individual produces its own unique whistle sound by which the others recognize him or her. They enjoy lifelong bonds and reconcile after fights by means of “petting.” The males form power-seeking coalitions, not unlike the politics of chimpanzees and humans. Dolphins also support sick companions near the surface, where they can breathe. They may encircle a school of herring, driving the fish together in a compact ball and releasing bubbles to keep them in place, after which they pick their food like fruit from a tree.",
              "In captivity, dolphins are known to imitate the gait and gestures of people walking by, and to outsmart their keepers. One female dolphin that was rewarded with a fish for every piece of debris she managed to collect from her tank managed to con her trainers into a bounty of snacks. They discovered she had been hiding large items like newspapers underwater, only to rip small pieces from them, bringing these to her trainer one by one.",
              "There are tons of such observations, which is why most of us believe in dolphin intelligence — glia or no glia. It also explains why the slaughter of dolphins, as still occurs every year in Japan, arouses such strong emotions and controversy. Still, I must admit that the whole dolphin affair has also offered me some fresh insights. From now on, if I find my goldfish thrashing on the floor, I will congratulate him before dropping him back into his bowl.",

              "HUMPBACK whales have a type of brain cell seen only in humans, the great apes, and other cetaceans such as dolphins, US researchers report. Patrick Hof and Estel Van der Gucht, of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, studied the brains of this endangered cetacean species, and discovered a \"spindle neuron\" in the cortex, in areas comparable to where they are seen in humans and great apes.",
              "Although the function of spindle neurons is not well understood, they may be involved in cognition — learning, remembering and recognition. Spindle cells may be affected by Alzheimer's disease and other debilitating brain disorders such as autism.This might mean such whales are more intelligent than they have been given credit for, and suggests the basis for complex brains either evolved more than once, or has gone unused by most species.",
              "The finding may help explain some of the behavior seen in whales, such as intricate communication skills, the formation of alliances, co-operation, cultural transmission and tool usage, the researchers reported in The Anatomical Record. Humpback whales are best known, of course, for their evocative courtship songs, so often heard in winter, in the waters off Hawaii, northeastern Australia, The Dominican Republic, and Mexico. A song may be several hours in duration. Songs display aspects of rhyming, with a content that provides information about the singer's vigor, as well as his lineage. You can listen to these songs, and watch a film of courting humpbacks at the excellent site of The Oceania Project.",
              "Interspecies.com researched humpbacks in 1994 in Southeast Alaska, to document one of the most communal alliances in all of nature. These whales do not travel in structured pods like dolphins. But when a whale discovers a school of food fish, it vocalizes a unique hunting call which sounds much more strident and edgy in tone than courting calls. This call attracts any other hungry whale in the vicinity, even if there has been no previous contact between the individuals. The spontaneous group displays an amazing sense of innate synchrony as they dive beneath the school, then start circling together, emitting enormous bubbles that virtually entrap the fish. The whales then rise directly into the school with their mouths wide open. The sight of several 40 to 60 foot whales breaking the surface, displaying the hot pink folds of their throats, rising ten or more feet out of the water with their mouths wide open, spraying silvery fish bodies high into the air, is one of the most dramatic sights in all of the animal kingdom. The orchestrated eruption of whales and fish, also attracts Steller sea lions, which grow to 4000 pounds, as well as Pacific white-sided dolphins.",
              "What you are listening to, is music composed by Jim Nollman that showcases these seldom-heard humpback hunting calls. Following the format of a classical Indian raga, the solo instrument is created from audio samples recorded in Alaska's Frederick Sound. Both the drone and the choir are created entirely from humpback courting calls. The drum is looped from samples of echolocation vocalized by Pacific white-sided dolphins, actually recorded as they accompanied feeding humpbacks near Port Hardy off Vancouver Island. The swishing sound is water current recorded during the same Port Hardy sessions. Entitled Humpy's Raga, this song is one selection from a CD of Interspecies music, which will be released in 2007 by Important Records. Enjoy."

              "Every so often, the news carries a story of a captive orca attacking its trainer. Several years ago, in Victoria, an orca drowned a trainer by holding her underwater. the latest incident occurred at San Diego SeaWorld in the middle of a show. The whale grabbed the trainer's foot and dragged him under, not once but twice, although finally letting him go. This event has prompted a lively internet discussion among whale protectors — who would love to close down the oceanaria of the world — trying to interpret precisely what this orca might have been trying to communicate. The most cited analysis concludes that, since the whale had known his trainer for many years, it was probably nothing personal. What probably was personal, was the show itself, which ostensibly had been driving the whale crazy, and finally caused him to crack and put a stop to it. If so, his communicated critique did work, at least for a while, because the whale has been granted a temporary sabbatical. Or, if you prefer to call it a suspension, it calls to mind the suspension of basketball player, Ron Artest, after he punched a fan. While Artest was unhappy to be suspended, the whale is probably left mulling over the limits of his newfound power to clearly speak his mind.",

              "In 2007, Interspecies.com was contracted by the US Navy to join one of two teams working to mitigate whale mortality from mid-frequency sonar tests. The team members were sonar and radar experts, whale biologists and pathologists. Being an organization comprised of artists, activists, ethicists, and generalists, we were more surprised than anyone to be included. After about a month, the Navy notified me that Interspecies nonprofit status did not qualify for a contract. I was then personally asked to join the program as a subcontractor. However, my own professional time is 100% dedicated to Interspecies affairs. To fulfill the contract, I have made daily use of Interspecies' resources, so I do consider Interspecies to be a member of the team. To keep it all balanced, some breathtakingly expensive software I purchased to fulfill the contract, has been donated to Interspecies. You can read what the Washington Post says about this $6 million program, here.",
              "Phase One of the program ended in September. I filed a report containing two critical recommendations. First, the formula currently being used by the Navy to compute the size of a test area is based on audio levels just below the threshold of sound that damages cetacean hearing. The test area needs to be larger, because whales are not precisely dying from physical damage, but from stampeding caused by the abruptness of the sonar. Intriguingly, none of the scientific papers I read on the subject used the word \"stampede\". Many called it \"avoidance behavior\". This author firmly believes that words have power. There is a critical difference in imagery, context, and potential for solution, between the two terms. Second, stampede is best mitigated by more gradually turning on the sonar to maximum amplitude. I have proposed a start-up warning signal that includes both whale and sonar sounds to alert the whales to the imminent danger, and presumably stop a stampede from ever developing. It would probably work because whale physiologists tell us that the toothed whales can tune out even the loudest sounds if they have time to acclimate. I personally witnessed this \"tuning out\" effect years ago, when Interspecies, Greenpeace, and the Animal Welfare Institute sent me to Iki Island Japan for 2 winters, to protect dolphins from the infamous drive fisheries.",
              "Phase Two begins this spring. Our team has submitted a proposal. If it is accepted, we will focus on developing a multi-sensored whale detection system, to pinpoint the presence of whales within the test area. If they are detected, the Navy will not test. The two recommendations I have sketched above, are also being considered. Keep tuned.",
              "The best statement of what Interspecies does in the world, is found here. During April and May, I have been invited to speak about the Interspecies vision of nature, at prestigious conferences in Germany, Spain, and possibly Holland. At the International Animal Welfare Conference in Barcelona, I will also do a performance elaborating how composers around the world are creating music from animal calls."

But when the novelty of the central premise ran out, I was left hungering for just a smidgeon of McKibbon's blessed optimism.

With similar intentions but a more devilish sense of entertainment values, Weisman turns the destruction of our civilization and the subsequent re-wilding of the planet into a Hollywood-worthy, slow-motion disaster spectacular and feel-good movie rolled into one.",

We jostle along a bumpy road through an expansive countryside. We, the ostensible operator of our own cerebral vehicle, may naturally feel more at ease the next time consciousness places down on this road less traveled. The pathways widen.

Ironically, if the medium is the message, then to call it \"extrasensory\" nearly assures that any plausible explanation will always defy a rational approach.

Nicholas was in his mid-sixties then, so I doubt he's still alive today. Some of the time he dazzled us with anecdotes about his own glimpses into other worlds.

              "This evening’s fiesta is just about over. Within a few more minutes all of us gringos will retreat to our own fastidiously screened palapas. There is simply no other escape from the local hordes of mosquitoes. Every night the process of our retreat has been the same. We pull on long-sleeved t-shirts over bathing suits, hang towels over our knees. Then we start slapping necks, hands, feet. One at a time people get up to leave. Finally, everyone, male, female, Mexican, American, is forced off the unscreened porch. I beat a hasty retreat to my own palapa, where I light a scented candle, find a good book,  climb into my shrouded hammock to escape the spiders, scorpions, and snakes that rule the night. Through a crack in the thatch. I can make out the form of Nicholas. He is still sitting on the porch, frailing the banjo. Every so often he puts it down, picks up his glass.",
              "After nearly a week here, I have never seen him slap his arm, or scratch his neck. He is apparently immune to the mosquitoes that torment everyone else.",
              "This morning, as  I sit alone on the cliff, opening a ripe coconut, Nicholas shuffles over to greet me, sits on his heels ands waits for me to offer a piece of the white flesh. We eat, talk about music, a jaguar we all heard growling late last night. I ask how he can avoid the mosquitoes. He chuckles, shakes his head, as if going out of his way to communicate how things he deems obvious always seems mysterious to gringos. He pushes his arm in front of my face, clenches his fist three times, requesting that I feel his forearm. “It’s a bit like that.” He explains. “A bit, but not exactly. You let the blood flow through your body in  certain way. The mosquitoes know the language of the blood. I’ve spent forty years here, so I’ve learn that language, too. I tell the mosquitoes to stay away.”",
              "Long after I left Nicholas’ seaside enclave, I wondered if the old man was able to entice mosquitoes to bite only him. Predictably, by then I had also deduced a rationale to explain his extra-sensors. The tequila he drank, plus the raw garlics and chiles he consumed so mightily, had finally rendered his blood unpalatable to bugs.",
              "Yet year’s later, I read about Rolling Thunder, who described a similar method for communicating with bugs. He wrote that mosquitoes won’t bother a person who maintains good feelings towards them. Every attitude generates vibrations. In this case, good vibrations have a smell to them. In other words, this particular extras-ensor produced a bug repellent. Rolling Thunder added that it is quite difficult to control this smell, because feelings remain inside while smells only exist outside.",
              "Had there been mosquitoes at the Sea of Galilee, I could imagine Jesus showing something like that to his own throg."

              "RESEARCH: New presentation and analysis tools for bio-acoustics are, slowly but surely, upgrading the process of unraveling whale language. This wonderful flash presentation by orca researcher, Val Veirs, provides both an innovative spatial component plus real time spectrograms to what is already a very revealing conversation between an orca mother and her calf who has briefly separated himself from the pod to go exploring. \"Here I am Mom, no need to worry.\"",
              "ART, MAY I INTRODUCE YOU TO SCIENCE: Animal song appears in human music from a wide variety of time periods and cultures, but the way it is used varies enormously. In cultures where people interact intensively with the natural world, music is often used to communicate with non-human animals, whether for practical, spiritual, playful or other purposes. Music often serves to bridge the gap between humans and non-humans. So begins the abstract of a fascinating paper entitled: Crickets in the Concert Hall, about how and why composers, throughout history, have incorporated animal calls into their own music.",
              "SURVIVAL: Don't miss this happy-ending video of a desperate penguin trying to find safety in a sea of pursuing orcas off the coast of Antarctica. Years ago, I wrote a much-published essay entitled \"What's Wrong with Nature Films\" which suggested several solutions to the lack of creativity of the Discovery Channel. Who could have ever guessed that Youtube's vast vaults would upgrade the medium so forcefully, by transforming the genre of otherwise slick and predictable nature films into a new people's medium?",

              "ORCA DESPAIR: An independent Canadian advisory panel will meet later this month to assess the status of one of the ocean's top predators: the killer whale. But whale experts suggest the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, known as COSEWIC, is unlikely to recommend sweeping changes to the species-at-risk designations of five distinct orca populations. No changes despite the fact that 10% of the entire southern population has died this past year. When you read this, don't forget to take a close look at the \"related stories\" section on the same page.",
              "PHOTOGRAPHY: Feast your eyes on some of the rarest and strangest of planet Earth's endangered species. Hang your head to realize that neither the rous, the solenodon, the aye-aye, or the olm will ever arouse human passion or pockets as tigers, pandas, and whales regularly do. But wait!

              "THE LONELIEST WHALE: In 1989, a team of Woods Hole biologists detected a unique sound in the North Pacific Ocean. It had all the repetitive, low-frequency earmarks of a great whale call, but at a frequency — 52 hertz — far higher than the normal 15-to-25-hertz range of blue or fin whales. Ever since, the biologists have picked up the lone call of this same 52-hertz whale and tracked it every year, as it roamed widely from offshore California to the Aleutian Islands off Alaska. One team member has said, “It is perhaps difficult to accept that if this was a whale, that there could have been only one of this kind in this large oceanic expanse, yet in spite of comprehensive, careful monitoring year-round, only one call with these characteristics has been found anywhere, and there has been only one source each season.”",
              "GETTING INTO THE GROOVE: Sperm whales may take as much pleasure in singing well-timed duets as humans do. New underwater recordings have shown that the whales carefully coordinate their song to match the calls of their singing partner. The animals appear to enjoy singing to each other, possibly to strengthen relationships among females within the group."
